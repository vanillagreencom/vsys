# matcher: Bash
# description: Block any rm with a path operand that starts with a variable that may expand empty. Names the rewrite the harness accepts without a prompt.
# summary: Stops a delete whose path starts with a variable that may be empty. Refusing this shape lets the agent rewrite it before a harness prompt stalls the session.
# safety: One regex over the raw command refuses any rm with an operand rooted in `$NAME`, `${NAME}` or `${NAME:-…}`, including globs, regardless of flags. `${NAME:?…}` aborts on empty and passes. A redirection target is not an operand. The scan can refuse harmless text that spells the same shape, such as `git rm --cached $X` or an echo containing `rm $X`. It does not parse shell syntax: a split command name or line continuation can escape it and still reach the harness prompt. Every refusal opens with `block-unsafe-rm: <key>=<value>`; output from a command this hook runs follows that line.

# The whole rule, built from named parts so each one is readable on its own.
# The parts count WHEREVER they stand in the command. There is no
# command-position test: one was tried, and a hand-written list of the keywords
# that may precede an rm is an enumeration of shell grammar — every revision of
# it named fewer members than it missed, and `if`, `while`, `until`, `!` and
# `time` all carried a real variable-rooted recursive rm straight past it.
# ENDERS is what remains of that reading: it says where one command ends and
# the next begins, so GAP and SKIP exclude it and a scan never REACHES out of
# the command it began in.
#
#   ENDERS    the characters that END one command: `;`, `&`, `|` and a newline.
#             The newline is one of them because the words of the next line are
#             not this rm's operands.
#   RM_EDGE   what may stand immediately left of the `rm`: the start of the
#             command, or any character an identifier cannot hold, so
#             `confirm -rf $X` is one word and not this hook's rm. It is a word
#             boundary and nothing more — bash's `=~` runs without REG_NEWLINE,
#             so `^` alone would never reach line two of a multi-line call, and
#             a newline is one of the characters this admits.
#   ROOT      an operand rooted in a variable that may expand empty: `$NAME`,
#             `${NAME}`, `${NAME:-…}`. `${NAME:?…}` aborts on empty and is the
#             accepted rewrite, so it is the one variable root that passes; the
#             identifier test is what keeps `${X+x:?}` — an unset-guarded
#             ALTERNATIVE whose text merely contains :? — on the refused side.
#             A leading double quote is peeled, since quoting does not stop an
#             empty expansion; a single-quoted run is a literal the shell never
#             expands and is not a variable root.
#   GAP       the whitespace standing between two words of ONE command. It is
#             horizontal whitespace and nothing else, because the only
#             whitespace character in ENDERS is the newline: a gap that crossed
#             one would read the next command's words as this rm's operands.
#   SKIP      the words the scan crosses to get from one part to the next: GAP
#             then a run of CROSSABLE, repeated. CROSSABLE is any character but
#             ENDERS, `<`, `>` and whitespace, so it is a word BODY and GAP is
#             the one thing between two words. An ender would end this rm, and
#             a redirection target is not an operand at all, so
#             `rm -rf /var/tmp/x > $LOG` is not a variable-rooted rm. Crossing
#             ordinary words reaches a later variable-rooted operand after
#             flags or literal operands.
#
# Flags do not affect the rule. Shell-assembled command names and line
# continuations remain outside this lexical scan.
# The ampersand leads so this string does not spell bash 4's case fall-through
# operator, which tools/bash32-lint flags in string data too. A bracket
# expression carries no order, so the set below is the set named above.
