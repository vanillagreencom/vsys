# matcher: Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Write|Bash
# description: For a subagent whose agent_type starts with `reviewer-`, refuses every Edit, MultiEdit and NotebookEdit call; a Write whose path lies inside a git work tree unless it is the review artifact, `<dir>/tmp/review-*.json`; and a Bash command that runs `git commit`, `push`, `checkout`, `restore`, `stash`, `clean`, `reset` or `switch` (options between `git` and the verb allowed). Any other agent, and a payload naming no agent_type, passes. Under Pi the pi-hooks carrier sends as agent_type the agent name a Pi subagent process is started with. Not run on codex: a write is `apply_patch` with no `tool_input.file_path`, so the review artifact cannot be told from any other write. Not run on gemini: its tool-call payload is unmeasured. Not run on copilot: its preToolUse payload names no calling agent. Not run on antigravity: its payload carries no agent field.
# summary: Keeps a reviewer agent read-only: no edits, no commits, no pushes, no Git commands that discard work, only its review report.
# safety: Reads the payload and asks git whether a path is inside a work tree; writes nothing. A payload it cannot read is refused, never skipped. The refusal names the artifact path a reviewer may write and never suggests bypassing. Every refusal opens with `reviewer-read-only: <key>=<value>`; what a command this hook runs writes is captured at the site and replayed under that line, so nothing precedes the key.

# Every line this hook writes, and the only place its text lives. The first
# line is the contract a reader parses, `reviewer-read-only: <key>=<value>`: a
# stable key for the condition and the value acted on — the missing tool, why
# the payload could not be read, the tool call refused, or the path a reviewer
# may not write. The English explanation follows it, and it never names a
# bypass.
# The keyed line stands first, at position 1. What a command this hook runs
# wrote is captured where the hook reads it and passed here as the cause, so
# it is replayed under the key rather than ahead of it.
