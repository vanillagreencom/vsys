# Contract test for the fail-closed measurement rule: a run that produced no
# samples is instrument failure, never a numeric or green result — and a zero
# RESULT on a measured run is the opposite, a finding that has to reach the
# orchestrator intact. Two halves, because the rule has two carriers:
#
#   a. Prose — the Ethos bullet in SKILL.md that binds every reviewer, and the
#      schema doc's statement of both the rejection and the declaration that
#      lets a reviewer keep its evidence.
#   b. Behavior — orch's review-artifact-check rejecting a zero-sample artifact,
#      accepting a measured one, and accepting a declared instrument failure. A
#      guard proven in one direction only is a guard that could be passing
#      vacuously, and the accepting cases are what pin WHICH number it reads.
#
# The behavioral half is skipped only for a reviewer-without-orch install (no
# sibling skills/orch at all). When orch IS installed, a missing or
# non-executable review-artifact-check is a failure, not a skip: that is
# precisely the drift this suite exists to catch, and skipping on it would make
# the branch fire only when it matters.
#
# The doc checks pin the schema's own names — `measurement_failed`, and the
# `zero_sample`, `invalid_declaration` and `valid_undermeasured` states. The
# gate's own behaviour is exercised against the script above, which is what
# proves it.
