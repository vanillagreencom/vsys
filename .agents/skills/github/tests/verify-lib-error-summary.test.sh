# Tests for verify-lib's run_stack failure summaries.
#
# Both failure branches built their summary as
# `echo "$output" | grep -E ... | head -5 | tr`. head closes the pipe on its
# fifth line and SIGPIPEs grep, and pipefail makes 141 the status of an
# unguarded assignment — so under errexit the branch died before recording
# anything: no builds/tests entry, no issue, for exactly the failures whose
# output is large. It survived only because verify_prs' one call site runs
# `run_stack ... || true`, and a command in an `||` list suppresses errexit for
# the whole call.
#
# So each case runs run_stack with errexit LIVE and reads RESULTS_JSON out of an
# EXIT trap, which is what the summary must survive. If either branch moves to
# its piped form reddens this suite.
#
# Run: bash skills/github/tests/verify-lib-error-summary.test.sh
