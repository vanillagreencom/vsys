# Tests for ci-logs against a log past the pipe buffer.
#
# Three sites in ci-logs.sh changed behaviour once the log outgrew a kernel
# bound, and `--lines` cannot hold a log under either: it caps lines, not bytes.
#
#   classify_error_type  `echo "$logs" | grep -qi PATTERN` — grep exits on its
#                        first match and SIGPIPEs the writer past the 64KB pipe
#                        buffer. In condition position errexit does not fire, so
#                        141 reads as a plain no-match and a log naming its own
#                        failure falls through to the job-name heuristics.
#   safe/json output     `jq -n --arg logs "$logs"` — a single argv string over
#                        MAX_ARG_STRLEN (128KB) is refused by the kernel, taking
#                        the whole result with it: nothing on stdout at all.
#   log_fetch_failed     `printf '%s' "$logs" | tr '\n' ' ' | head -c 300` —
#                        head closes after 300 bytes, and that assignment has no
#                        guard, so errexit kills the branch that exists to
#                        report the fetch failure: exit 141, no JSON, no message.
#
# One staged log clears both bounds, at the default `--lines`. Each site
# uses an early-closing reader, this suite turns red.
#
