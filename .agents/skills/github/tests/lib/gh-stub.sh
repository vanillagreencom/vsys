# One `gh` fake for the shell suites, answering from files a test stages.
#
# The shell suites each wrote their own `gh` heredoc: a `case` over the
# handful of verbs that suite needed, seeded with whichever identity answers
# its code path asked for — `auth status`, `api user`, `repo view` — and a
# refusal for the rest. The answer sets differ per suite, so the duplication
# was never in them; it was in the scaffolding around them, and in a per-suite
# pile of STUB_* environment knobs that made a scenario something you read by
# tracing which knob a case branch happened to consult.
#
# Here the shape is inverted: the stub has no knowledge of any suite. Install
# and reset seed the three identity probes documented below. A test STAGES
# every other answer, and an unstaged call is refused, so a suite cannot pass
# on a call it never meant the code to make.
#
# Usage, from a test:
#
#   . "$TEST_DIR/lib/gh-stub.sh"
#   gh_stub_install "$TMP/bin"        # writes $TMP/bin/gh, exports STUB_DIR
#   PATH="$TMP/bin:$PATH"
#
#   gh_stub_answer pr-list '[]'                     # every `pr list` call
#   gh_stub_answer_seq api-graphql "$page_one"      # 1st `api graphql` call
#   gh_stub_answer_seq api-graphql "$page_two"      # 2nd, then refused
#   gh_stub_fail repo-view 1 'repository unavailable'
#   gh_stub_calls                                   # the argv of every call
#
# THE VERB is the first two argv words joined by `-`, with the second dropped
# when it is flag-shaped: `auth status` → `auth-status`, `api graphql -f q=…`
# → `api-graphql`, `pr list --state merged` → `pr-list`, `api
# repos/o/r/issues/1/comments` → that whole path after `api-`. When nothing
# is staged under that two-word verb, the FIRST word alone is tried — so
# `gh_stub_answer api '[]'` answers every api path a suite did not name one
# at a time, and staging neither is still a refusal.
#
# THE KEY a verb names is one file stem: the verb's words as written, with
# `/` spelled `%` because a stem is a file name. Two verbs can therefore
# reach one stem — `api-a/b` and `api-a%b` do — so a stem records the verb
# that staged it, and a staging under a second verb is REFUSED rather than
# overwriting the first one's answer without a word. Restaging the same verb
# is how a suite overrides a seeded answer or extends a sequence, and stays.
#
# A VERB IS NOT ALWAYS ENOUGH. Two `api graphql` calls carrying different
# queries are one verb, and answering both the same way would let a suite
# pass with the wrong query on the wire. So a staged verb may carry a
# selector — `api-graphql:mergeQueueEntry` — and the stub takes the first
# selector whose text occurs anywhere in the call's argv, falling back to the
# plain verb. Selectors are tried in the order they were staged.
#
# WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not read GH_TOKEN, GH_REPO or
# any other part of gh's own environment contract, and it does not judge a
# call's flags. A suite whose SUBJECT is which token gh was handed, or which
# filters a command sent, has to see those itself: the assertion is the whole
# point of that suite, and moving it in here would bury it. Those suites read
# `gh_stub_calls` and assert on the argv, or keep a bespoke fake.

# start from them, so the seeded owner/repo is written in one place.
