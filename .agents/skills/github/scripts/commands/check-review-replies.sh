Usage: check-review-replies <PR_NUMBER>

Reads the pull request's review threads, its review bodies at the current
head and, when a review body holds findings, its PR-level comments. The
repository is GH_REPO, else the checkout's GitHub remote. Writes nothing.

Rules (each fails on its own):
  untracked-claim     A thread's standing reply claims tracking and names
                      no issue (KEN-123, #123).
  unreasoned-decline  A thread's standing decline names no mechanism.
  thread-replies      A thread holds more comments than one read returns,
                      so its replies cannot be judged.
  suppressed-findings A review at the head lists findings in its body under
                      `Suppressed comments (N)` or `Previously missed (N)`
                      (a markdown heading or a <details> summary), and no
                      counted reply answers each one.

Whose words count:
  A finding source, a review body, counts when its author is a bot or has
  author association OWNER, MEMBER or COLLABORATOR, and is not the PR
  author. A reply counts when its author is the PR author or the identity
  this check runs as (the token's GraphQL viewer), whatever its actor type,
  or has one of those associations. An account is its numeric id (REST
  user.id, GraphQL databaseId), never its login: an account named like an
  app is not the app. Anyone else's review or reply is read as if it were
  not there.

A thread's first comment is the finding it opens, never a reply. Its
standing reply is its newest counted later comment that is
`Fixed in <sha>`, `Declined: ...` or carries a track word. A decline
opening with the word without the colon is still a decline for
unreasoned-decline. What a decline must say is reviewer conduct:
.agents/skills/orch/references/finding-disposition.md § Decision flow.

A body finding is answered by a counted PR-level comment whose first
non-blank line opens `Dispositions at <sha>`, <sha> being 7 to 40 hex
characters the current head starts with, and a line per finding opening
with its `file:line` token, bare, bold or backticked, then the reply:

  Dispositions at 1a2b3c4:
  `src/a.ts:12` - Declined: the caller rejects the empty case first.
  `src/b.ts:40` - Tracked: KEN-123

The reply is read by the thread grammar, so a label-only decline or a
tracking claim naming no issue answers nothing. A comment bound to an
earlier head answers nothing at this one, and so does a comment with any
other line opening `Dispositions at <sha>`, fenced or not. The newest line
naming an entry decides.

Output, stdout:
  review-replies: pass head=<sha>
  review-replies: fail head=<sha>
followed on fail by one line per failing rule, and for an unanswered body
finding one line per entry:
  untracked-claim count=<n>
  unreasoned-decline count=<n>
  thread-replies state=truncated threads=<n>
  suppressed-findings count=<n>
  suppressed-findings state=unparsed
  suppressed-findings state=mismatch sections=<n>
  suppressed-entry <file:line>        (one per unanswered finding)
`sections` counts the findings sections, across every review body read,
whose own count differs from the entries parsed under that section.
stderr explains each line. On `suppressed-findings count=<n>`, stderr
also names, once per login, each author who does not count and wrote a
head-bound disposition comment with a line naming any finding a review body
lists, answered or not:
  suppressed-findings: ignored-author login=<login>
A thread reply that does not count adds no line.

Exit codes:
  0  every rule passes
  1  a rule fails
  2  usage error, or a read failed or named no account id for the PR
     author or the viewer: no verdict. The first stderr line is
     `check-review-replies: <key> pr=<n>`; take no action on it.

# THE REPLY FORMS, spelled once above both reductions that read one: the two
# thread rules, and the suppressed-finding disposition read further down,
# which answers a body finding in a PR comment because no thread carries it.
# A change to what a decline is reaches all three. They read different sets
# on purpose.
# `disposition` is the canonical colon form, and the untracked-claim rule is
# the only thing it may mean: widening it there would let "Declined under the
# cap, tracked separately" clear a tracking claim naming no issue. `declined`
# is wider, matching any reply opening with the word, because the replies the
# second rule exists to catch had no colon.
#
# A decline is a disposition only when it says what it disproves, so the
# second reduction subtracts. `reason_left` strips the reply form, the
# non-reason tokens and the words carrying no content alone; a reply whose
# reason strips to nothing is counted, which is what leaves a token INSIDE a
# real reason harmless. Widen this list from ../tests/corpus/, never alone.
# Punctuation normalization keeps every letter and number, not only ASCII:
# the word lists are ASCII, so a reason written in another script survives
# whole, and surviving text is residue, which is a stated reason.
#
# Tracker ids go first, while each is still one token and still uppercase:
# punctuation normalization would otherwise leave the letters behind, and
# `Declined: KEN-881` would read as a stated reason of "ken". The shape is
# `names_issue`'s, the one spelling of a tracker id, so no reduction can
# disagree about what an id is.
#
# Two NAME strips ride after BOTH word lists, and both are positional rather
# than a vocabulary: no set of names is read or listed anywhere. A count
# takes the non-space run immediately in front of it, because that run is
# what was counted: "lifecycle 104/104" is one phrase and neither half says
# anything about the finding. A slash-joined token is a path, and a path is a
# name: "tools/guard" goes whole.
#
# BOTH WORD LISTS RUN FIRST, and that is load-bearing. A strip eats a whole
# run, so in front of a list it eats the TAIL of a phrase and strands the
# head: "out of scope 3/3" leaves "out" and "lifecycle is green at 104/104"
# leaves "lifecycle", and a decline this rule exists to catch passes by
# appending a count. A word the rule deletes never shields the name behind
# it; each list has its own section of ../tests/corpus/declines-unreasoned.txt
# and its own must-fail probe.
#
# The punctuation pass therefore runs ahead of both lists, so the lists read
# normalized text; but it HOLDS a dot, underscore or hyphen sitting between
# two alphanumerics, so a name is still one run when the strips look and
# "merge-queue 12/12" does not leave "merge". Every multi-word list entry
# accepts those separators for the same reason, and what the strips leave is
# flattened afterwards. Widening that hold to the apostrophe would break
# "won't fix", which the lists read as "won t fix".
#
# Both lists are bounded on ALPHANUMERICS rather than on \b for the same
# reason, so a held separator is a boundary for them as it is for the
# strips: `\b` reads `_` as a word character. `word_strip` spells that
# boundary by consuming the reason in run-aligned pieces (a separator run, a
# listed word plus the one character ending it, or an unlisted run), so every
# match starts where the last ended, at a run start. The space padded onto
# the END is how a word in the last position meets that one-character
# boundary; the closing trim takes both pads back.
#
# Position is the only thing that separates a suite name from prose: both
# are ordinary English, so any SET of names is a word ban on whatever the
# repo happens to name its files after, and "the guard refuses this path" is
# a real reason written in three of them. What position does not reach is
# pinned in ../tests/corpus/declines-known-limit.txt: a name standing after
# the count, a count not spelled N/N, a path whose own segments are listed
# words, and a slash written inside a multi-word entry.

# WHO COUNTS, spelled once for every reader: the thread rules, the review
# body scan and the disposition read. On a public repository an account
# with no standing can review and reply; read as the author's, its
# `Fixed in` would clear a failing reply, and read as a reviewer's, its
# review body would block the merge. GitHub's author association is the
# repository role the platform itself reports on every comment and review.
#
# A finding source counts when it is a bot or a repository member, and is
# not the PR author: a review bot such as Copilot reviews with association
# NONE, and an installed app is the only bot that can post one. A reply
# counts when it is the PR author's or the viewer's, whatever its actor
# type, or a repository member's. The viewer is the identity this check
# reads as, which the router selected and post-reply and post-comment
# answer under: a lane answers a PR a person opened as its GitHub App, a
# Bot with association CONTRIBUTOR or NONE, and its replies may also be
# posted under a maintainer's own login.
#
# AN ACCOUNT IS ITS NUMERIC ID, the one key every identity test compares:
# REST `user.id`, GraphQL `databaseId`, which name the same account on both
# surfaces. A login is a name anyone can register: a User account named like
# an app's slug is not the app, whatever case or [bot] suffix either spelling
# carries. $author and $viewer are accounts, `{id, login}`; the login rides
# along only as the name a diagnostic prints. An actor with no id (a deleted
