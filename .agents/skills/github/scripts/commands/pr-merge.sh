Merge PR as bot account with safety checks

Usage: pr-merge <PR_NUMBER> [options]

Options:
  --squash         Squash and merge (default)
  --merge          Create merge commit
  --rebase         Rebase and merge
  --delete-branch  Delete branch after merge (default: true)
  --keep-branch    Keep branch after merge
  --check          Run checks only, don't merge. JSON on stdout; a one-word
                   verdict (mergeable|blocked|merged|closed) plus the run
                   scope ("head-run: <ids>" — the runs the CI classification
                   was scoped to) on stderr. On a refusal,
                   ci-classify-refusal names the cause.
  --auto           If immediate merge is blocked, enable GitHub auto-merge
                   (will fire when CI + branch protection clear). Exits 75.
                   Never bypasses actionable unresolved review threads.
  --expected-head SHA
                   Bind GitHub's match-head merge guard to prepared SHA.
  --require-context NAME
                   With --auto only: arm only where the base branch requires
                   the status-check context NAME, read from the same required
                   set the CI gate uses. The arm right after a PR opens passes
                   the review gate's context, so nothing merges before review.
  --dry-run        Show what would happen without merging

Modes:
  (default)        Run checks, block if critical issues, merge if pass
  --check          Run checks, output JSON for workflow to parse
  --auto           Enable auto-merge when immediate merge is blocked

Merge-mode exit codes:
  0    MERGED PR #N
       Merge completed immediately.
  0    ALREADY MERGED PR #N <mergedAt>
       The PR was merged before this call. Nothing was attempted.
  75   QUEUED IN MERGE QUEUE PR #N
       The required merge queue has an active entry.
  75   AUTO-MERGE ENABLED PR #N
       Classic auto-merge is armed until protection clears.
  1    BLOCKED PR #N
       The requested operation failed; a pre-existing queue entry or auto-merge request may remain active.
  1    arm: no-merge-gate=<allow_auto_merge|required_check|required_context|unverified> repo=<owner/repo>
       --auto refused, nothing mutated: GitHub would merge at once with nothing to wait on,
       or, for required_context, without the --require-context check. unverified is a
       rules read that failed, which proves no gate.
  1    CLOSED (not merged) PR #N
       The PR is closed unmerged. Nothing was attempted.
  1    pr-merge: retired-setting key=<NAME>
       A retired merge setting is set. Every mode, --check included, refuses
       before any pull-request read or merge call; see Retired settings below.

--check exit:
  --check exits 0 after any valid readiness JSON, including can_merge=false for
  blocked or CLOSED. Argument or dispatch failures before JSON remain nonzero,
  and so does the retired-setting refusal: exit 1, no JSON on stdout, the
  refusal's first line on stderr.

Exit 75 is volatile:
  A queue ejection can disarm merge state. Block on .agents/skills/orch/scripts/queue-wait <N> <poll> <budget> --json before returning; it produces the verdict for the head just armed. Size the poll and budget as orch merge-pr.md § 5 step 1 does: the default budget outlives any foreground call an agent harness holds, so a call without them is killed before the verdict.
  Route verdicts through queue-wait --help Verdicts, named by SKILL.md § PR Merge Outcomes; the review-gate reducer still reports fleet attention.
  Re-arm only through github.sh pr-merge <N> --auto after that route.
  await-mergeable is not the lifecycle watcher; it stops when GitHub computes state.

Merge route:
  Every merge goes through the base branch's merge queue where the base
  requires one. No mode passes --admin to GitHub, so GitHub enrolls the PR
  in the queue (exit 75) rather than merging past it, under whatever token the
  auth ladder selected: in a lane sandbox, the lanes app's installation token.

Retired settings:
  ORCH_ADMIN_MERGE_GH_CONFIG_DIR, ORCH_ADMIN_MERGE_CLASSES and
  ORCH_MERGE_BYPASS named the overseer's owner-credential merge and the direct
  fast path ahead of the queue, and both routes are gone. The project settings
  are loaded the way every kendex script loads them: kendex.settings.toml
  [env], .kendex/settings.toml [env], the private env file (.env.local unless
  KENDEX_ENV_FILE names another) and the environment. A key set in any of
  them, empty value included, refuses every mode before any pull-request read
  or merge call, one first line per key set, and the last line names the keys
  again, so a repository that still expects either route learns it at the
  first call.

Terminal and mutation rules:
  After github.sh router setup, MERGED or CLOSED short-circuits pr-merge safety
  checks, bot-token load, and merge-state mutation; UNKNOWN continues. --check reports state.

  Every gh pr merge invocation is exact-head guarded by --match-head-commit; a changed head is BLOCKED.
  Queue membership comes from GraphQL isInMergeQueue and mergeQueueEntry. An
  OPEN PR with an active queue entry exits 75 even when autoMergeRequest is
  absent. An OPEN PR with no queue or auto-merge proof fails closed. The
  --delete-branch cleanup after MERGED is best-effort, not merge-state mutation.

Review-thread gate:
  Unresolved, non-outdated review threads make can_merge false and block both
  immediate merge and --auto. A failed or malformed thread lookup also blocks.
  This is narrower than required_conversation_resolution, which requires every
  conversation resolved and does not exclude outdated threads.

  The review gate's class policy is the one thing that waives it, because this
  gate is that gate's thread term. <skills>/review-gate/scripts/review-policy,
  else review-policy on PATH, is the only owner asked, and only once an
  unresolved thread, or a thread whose waiver resolution still stands, exists,
  since nothing else here turns on its answer: --check-config says
  whether a policy is active, and an active one is asked about this pull
  request's own base and head. The classifier takes a merge-base diff, so both
  commits AND an ancestor they share must be in this checkout for a class to
  be measured at all, and baseRefOid is the base branch's current tip: the two
  SHAs are fetched from origin (no tags, no FETCH_HEAD rewrite) when the range
  is not readable, and it is checked again. required and current keep the
  gate. No policy script and an inactive policy both keep it.

  Which threads a none answer waives, the reply the merge route leaves, and
  when a resolution it made lapses are the review gate's rule
  (<skills>/review-gate/scripts/lib/waiver.sh, beside the review-policy
  owner), which the review gate's own thread term reads too. An owner with
  no rule beside it blocks with review_policy_unreadable only where the rule
  could change the answer: an unresolved thread, or a resolved one carrying
  the merge route's reply. REVIEW_GATE_THREADS=off leaves review-policy
  --review-bots naming no bot, so nothing is waived there. A
  review_evidence=none answer waives the threads only a review bot has
  written in: the first comment and every other comment by an author GitHub
  types Bot whose login review-policy --review-bots names, or a waiver reply
  by an author GitHub types Bot, with the whole thread read. It reports them
  as unresolved_threads_waived, a warning that gates nothing, and names them in
  thread_waiver, outdated ones included, because GitHub's thread-resolution
  rule counts those. Every other unresolved thread blocks with
  unresolved_threads under that answer, outdated or not, for the same reason:
  a person's thread, a code-scanning alert, another app's thread, and a bot
  thread a person has replied in.

  The merge modes, never --check or --dry-run, then resolve each waived thread
  as the last step before the merge call, under the merge's own token: one
  reply opening "Resolved by the merge route: change class <class> at <head>,",
  then a resolve, each reported as RESOLVED THREAD <id> on stderr. They do so
  only where the head the class was measured at is the head being merged. A
  failed reply or resolve, or a head that moved, is BLOCKED with nothing armed.

  A waiver resolution lapses while it is still the thread's last word (the
  resolver's newest comment in the thread is a waiver reply) and the answer
  at the current head does not waive the thread. A lapsed waiver
  counts under unresolved_threads and is named in thread_reopen; the merge
  modes, never --check or --dry-run, reopen it and report REOPENED THREAD
  <id> on stderr, or pr-merge: thread-reopen-failed id=<id>. A thread someone
  answered and resolved again is theirs and no longer a waiver.

  An unreadable policy or review-bot list, or an endpoint still missing after
  the fetch, blocks with review_policy_unreadable in every mode, --auto
  included, and is never a waiver; the child's own diagnostics reach stderr
  so the cause is named. Conflicts, required contexts, the exact-head guard
  and the base branch's own conversation-resolution rule are untouched by
  every answer.

  The gate is policy, not mechanism. It applies only through pr-merge. A raw
  gh pr merge call or the GitHub UI Merge button bypasses it.

--check JSON:
  stdout is one object with these fields:
    can_merge   boolean readiness result
    issues      blocking issue strings
    warnings    non-blocking issue strings
    mergeable   MERGEABLE, CONFLICTING, or UNKNOWN
    review      GitHub review decision
    transient   true only when every blocker can clear by waiting
    state       OPEN, MERGED, CLOSED, or UNKNOWN
    merged_at   merge timestamp, or an empty string
    head_runs   run IDs used for CI classification
    checks      raw check rollup read by the classification
    required_contexts
                base-branch contexts the classification may block on
    thread_waiver
                null, or {class, head, threads}: the change class, the head
                SHA it was measured at and the review-bot thread IDs the
                class policy waived, which the merge modes resolve
    thread_reopen
                the thread IDs whose waiver resolution has lapsed, which the
                merge modes reopen and --check only names

  stderr carries mergeable, blocked, merged, or closed, followed by
  head-run: <ids> when CI runs were classified. can_merge=false with an empty
  issues array means the PR is terminal; inspect state instead of treating it
  as a blocker to repair.

  transient=true requires every issue prefix to be unknown:, ci_pending:,
  ci_unconfigured:, or ci_fetch_failed:. A ci_failed: issue is permanent, as
  are conflicts and changes_requested. Running checks use ci_pending: while
  failed or cancelled checks use ci_failed:.

  ci_pending: and ci_failed: name only contexts the base branch requires, read
  from its rulesets and classic protection. A red check outside that set is a
  ci_optional_failed: warning, which blocks nothing — GitHub merges over it. A
  required context that has registered no check on the head is ci_pending:
  "<context> (missing)", the state GitHub itself is in while it waits. A base
  that requires nothing, whose protection cannot be read, or whose ruleset
  carries a rule gating the merge on a check it does not name, counts every
  check as before.

  head_runs contains the authoritative workflow run plus runs referenced by
  custom commit statuses. checks is the same snapshot consumed by
  ci-classify-refusal <N>, so cause:, fail:, and superseded: lines cannot race
  a second fetch.

Examples:
  github.sh pr-merge 42 --check          # Check only, JSON output
  github.sh pr-merge 42                  # Check + merge if pass
  github.sh pr-merge 42 --auto           # Merge now or queue auto-merge

# The base branch's required status-check contexts as a JSON array: the
# ruleset and classic-protection endpoints merge_gate_gap already reads, read
# for their context names instead of their presence. GitHub merges a PR whose
# non-required checks are red, so these names are what the CI gate may block
# on. Any answer that is not positive evidence of the whole required set
# prints `[]`, which counts every check — a branch whose protection cannot be
# read must never merge over a red one.
#
# An empty classic list counts only when the branch answer actually carried a
# `protection` object. GitHub omits that key from the branch payload for a
# caller without push access, and a missing key parses cleanly and exits 0, so
# reading it as "nothing required" would narrow the set to the ruleset
# contexts alone under a read-only token.
#
# The ruleset read also refuses on a rule type it cannot account for. Only
# `required_status_checks` names its contexts; the types listed in the filter
# below gate the ref, its commits, its files or its reviews and put nothing in
# the check rollup. `pull_request` is the review gate among them: it demands a
# REVIEW, which arrives as a review and is already carried by this command's
# review-thread gates, never as a check on the head. `copilot_code_review`
# only requests a review and gates no merge at all. Every other type — `workflows`, `code_scanning`,
# `code_quality`, `code_coverage` and whatever GitHub adds next — gates the
# merge on a check result whose context the rule never names, so naming a
# required set beside one would drop that check's red to a warning. An
# unrecognized type therefore turns the narrowing OFF rather than merging over
# a check the read cannot see. Rule types: docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/rules
