Merge PR as bot account with safety checks

Usage: pr-merge <PR_NUMBER> [options]

Options:
  --squash         Squash and merge (default)
  --merge          Create merge commit
  --rebase         Rebase and merge
  --delete-branch  Delete branch after merge (default: true)
  --keep-branch    Keep branch after merge
  --check          Run checks only, don't merge. JSON on stdout; a one-word
                   verdict (mergeable|blocked|merged|closed) plus the run
                   scope ("head-run: <ids>" — the runs the CI classification
                   was scoped to) on stderr. On a refusal,
                   ci-classify-refusal names the cause.
  --force          Skip checks and merge (requires explicit user decision;
                   cannot be combined with --auto)
  --admin          Explicit current-user admin merge; skips checks; conflicts with --auto
  --auto           If immediate merge is blocked, enable GitHub auto-merge
                   (will fire when CI + branch protection clear). Exits 75.
                   Never bypasses actionable unresolved review threads.
  --expected-head SHA
                   Bind GitHub's match-head merge guard to prepared SHA.
  --dry-run        Show what would happen without merging

Modes:
  (default)        Run checks, block if critical issues, merge if pass
  --check          Run checks, output JSON for workflow to parse
  --force/--admin  Deliberately skip all checks; --admin passes --admin to GitHub
  --auto           Enable auto-merge when immediate merge is blocked

Merge-mode exit codes:
  0    MERGED PR #N
       Merge completed immediately.
  0    ALREADY MERGED PR #N <mergedAt>
       The PR was merged before this call. Nothing was attempted.
  75   QUEUED IN MERGE QUEUE PR #N
       The required merge queue has an active entry.
  75   AUTO-MERGE ENABLED PR #N
       Classic auto-merge is armed until protection clears.
  1    BLOCKED PR #N
       The requested operation failed; a pre-existing queue entry or auto-merge request may remain active.
  1    CLOSED (not merged) PR #N
       The PR is closed unmerged. Nothing was attempted.

--check exit:
  --check exits 0 after any valid readiness JSON, including can_merge=false for
  blocked or CLOSED. Argument or dispatch failures before JSON remain nonzero.

Exit 75 is volatile:
  A queue ejection can disarm merge state. Block on .agents/skills/orch/scripts/queue-wait <N> <poll> <budget> --json before returning; it produces the verdict for the head just armed. Size the poll and budget as orch merge-pr.md § 5 step 1 does: the default budget outlives any foreground call an agent harness holds, so a call without them is killed before the verdict.
  Route verdicts through queue-wait --help Verdicts, named by SKILL.md § PR Merge Outcomes; the review-gate reducer still reports fleet attention.
  Re-arm only through github.sh pr-merge <N> --auto after that route.
  await-mergeable is not the lifecycle watcher; it stops when GitHub computes state.

Terminal and mutation rules:
  After github.sh router setup, MERGED or CLOSED short-circuits pr-merge safety
  checks, bot-token load, and merge-state mutation; UNKNOWN continues. --check reports state.

  Every gh pr merge invocation is exact-head guarded by --match-head-commit; a changed head is BLOCKED.
  Queue membership comes from GraphQL isInMergeQueue and mergeQueueEntry. An
  OPEN PR with an active queue entry exits 75 even when autoMergeRequest is
  absent. An OPEN PR with no queue or auto-merge proof fails closed. The
  --delete-branch cleanup after MERGED is best-effort, not merge-state mutation.

Review-thread gate:
  Unresolved, non-outdated review threads make can_merge false and block both
  immediate merge and --auto. A failed or malformed thread lookup also blocks.
  This is narrower than required_conversation_resolution, which requires every
  conversation resolved and does not exclude outdated threads.

  The gate is policy, not mechanism. It applies only through pr-merge. A raw
  gh pr merge call or the GitHub UI Merge button bypasses it.

Force rules:
  --force and --admin skip every check, including the thread gate. --admin also
  requests GitHub's branch-protection bypass. Both are immediate-only and
  conflict with --auto. A failed override remains BLOCKED unless the exact-head
  post-state is MERGED; pending merge state is not success.

--check JSON:
  stdout is one object with these fields:
    can_merge   boolean readiness result
    issues      blocking issue strings
    warnings    non-blocking issue strings
    mergeable   MERGEABLE, CONFLICTING, or UNKNOWN
    review      GitHub review decision
    transient   true only when every blocker can clear by waiting
    state       OPEN, MERGED, CLOSED, or UNKNOWN
    merged_at   merge timestamp, or an empty string
    head_runs   run IDs used for CI classification
    checks      raw check rollup read by the classification

  stderr carries mergeable, blocked, merged, or closed, followed by
  head-run: <ids> when CI runs were classified. can_merge=false with an empty
  issues array means the PR is terminal; inspect state instead of treating it
  as a blocker to repair.

  transient=true requires every issue prefix to be unknown:, ci_pending:,
  ci_unconfigured:, or ci_fetch_failed:. A ci_failed: issue is permanent, as
  are conflicts and changes_requested. Running checks use ci_pending: while
  failed or cancelled checks use ci_failed:.

  head_runs contains the authoritative workflow run plus runs referenced by
  custom commit statuses. checks is the same snapshot consumed by
  ci-classify-refusal <N>, so cause:, fail:, and superseded: lines cannot race
  a second fetch.

Examples:
  github.sh pr-merge 42 --check          # Check only, JSON output
  github.sh pr-merge 42                  # Check + merge if pass
  github.sh pr-merge 42 --auto           # Merge now or queue auto-merge
  github.sh pr-merge 42 --force          # Explicit local override (DANGEROUS)
  github.sh pr-merge 42 --admin          # Explicit admin override (DANGEROUS)
