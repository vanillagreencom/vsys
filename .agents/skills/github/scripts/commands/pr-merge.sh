Merge PR as bot account with safety checks

Usage: pr-merge <PR_NUMBER> [options]

Options:
  --squash         Squash and merge (default)
  --merge          Create merge commit
  --rebase         Rebase and merge
  --delete-branch  Delete branch after merge (default: true)
  --keep-branch    Keep branch after merge
  --check          Run checks only, don't merge. JSON on stdout; a one-word
                   verdict (mergeable|blocked|merged|closed) plus the run
                   scope ("head-run: <ids>" — the runs the CI classification
                   was scoped to) on stderr. On a refusal,
                   ci-classify-refusal names the cause.
  --force          Skip checks and merge (requires explicit user decision;
                   cannot be combined with --auto)
  --admin          Explicit current-user admin merge; skips checks; conflicts with --auto
  --admin-credential
                   Overseer route: merge the exact head with the control
                   host's owner credential after every merge condition is
                   checked. Requires --expected-head. Immediate-only and
                   exclusive with --check, --auto, --force, --admin and
                   --dry-run. See Admin-credential route below.
  --auto           If immediate merge is blocked, enable GitHub auto-merge
                   (will fire when CI + branch protection clear). Exits 75.
                   Never bypasses actionable unresolved review threads.
  --expected-head SHA
                   Bind GitHub's match-head merge guard to prepared SHA.
  --dry-run        Show what would happen without merging

Modes:
  (default)        Run checks, block if critical issues, merge if pass
  --check          Run checks, output JSON for workflow to parse
  --force/--admin  Deliberately skip all checks; --admin passes --admin to GitHub
  --auto           Enable auto-merge when immediate merge is blocked

Merge-mode exit codes:
  0    MERGED PR #N
       Merge completed immediately.
  0    ALREADY MERGED PR #N <mergedAt>
       The PR was merged before this call. Nothing was attempted.
  75   QUEUED IN MERGE QUEUE PR #N
       The required merge queue has an active entry.
  75   AUTO-MERGE ENABLED PR #N
       Classic auto-merge is armed until protection clears.
  1    BLOCKED PR #N
       The requested operation failed; a pre-existing queue entry or auto-merge request may remain active.
  1    arm: no-merge-gate=<allow_auto_merge|required_check|unverified> repo=<owner/repo>
       --auto refused, nothing mutated: GitHub would merge at once with nothing to wait on.
  1    CLOSED (not merged) PR #N
       The PR is closed unmerged. Nothing was attempted.

--check exit:
  --check exits 0 after any valid readiness JSON, including can_merge=false for
  blocked or CLOSED. Argument or dispatch failures before JSON remain nonzero.

Exit 75 is volatile:
  A queue ejection can disarm merge state. Block on .agents/skills/orch/scripts/queue-wait <N> <poll> <budget> --json before returning; it produces the verdict for the head just armed. Size the poll and budget as orch merge-pr.md § 5 step 1 does: the default budget outlives any foreground call an agent harness holds, so a call without them is killed before the verdict.
  Route verdicts through queue-wait --help Verdicts, named by SKILL.md § PR Merge Outcomes; the review-gate reducer still reports fleet attention.
  Re-arm only through github.sh pr-merge <N> --auto after that route.
  await-mergeable is not the lifecycle watcher; it stops when GitHub computes state.

Terminal and mutation rules:
  After github.sh router setup, MERGED or CLOSED short-circuits pr-merge safety
  checks, bot-token load, and merge-state mutation; UNKNOWN continues. --check reports state.

  Every gh pr merge invocation is exact-head guarded by --match-head-commit; a changed head is BLOCKED.
  Queue membership comes from GraphQL isInMergeQueue and mergeQueueEntry. An
  OPEN PR with an active queue entry exits 75 even when autoMergeRequest is
  absent. An OPEN PR with no queue or auto-merge proof fails closed. The
  --delete-branch cleanup after MERGED is best-effort, not merge-state mutation.

Review-thread gate:
  Unresolved, non-outdated review threads make can_merge false and block both
  immediate merge and --auto. A failed or malformed thread lookup also blocks.
  This is narrower than required_conversation_resolution, which requires every
  conversation resolved and does not exclude outdated threads.

  The gate is policy, not mechanism. It applies only through pr-merge. A raw
  gh pr merge call or the GitHub UI Merge button bypasses it.

Admin-credential route:
  The overseer's one merge verb for a pull request that needs no further
  process. It overrides no gate: it re-checks every condition below on the
  exact head itself, dequeues a queued PR, then merges with the control host's
  owner credential, whose --admin flag bypasses branch protection for the
  merge alone. It runs ONLY on the control host: ORCH_ADMIN_MERGE_GH_CONFIG_DIR
  names the gh config directory holding the owner credential, and an empty
  value or a path that is not a directory refuses the route. GH_TOKEN and
  GITHUB_TOKEN are cleared for every call, so a lane's own token can never
  reach the merge; the credential itself is never read, printed or passed on.

  Every condition is checked on --expected-head before any mutation, and a
  failed one refuses with nothing dequeued and nothing merged:
    class     ORCH_ADMIN_MERGE_CLASSES, empty for every class. A set value is
              a comma- or space-separated list drawn from the classes the
              classifier names: render, trivial, micro, small and standard.
              The class comes from the change classifier, never from a flag, a
              label, a branch name or any other author-writable field. The
              classifier is <skills>/harness-ci/scripts/change-class, else
              change-class on PATH, called with --event pull_request and the
              base and head SHAs; a classifier that resolves to nothing, exits
              nonzero or answers anything but one change_class= line refuses
              the merge with class-unreadable. An empty list is every class, not
              the route off — only an empty config directory turns the route off.
    head      the live head equals --expected-head
    review    the review gate is met: GitHub's reviewDecision is APPROVED, or an
              approving review stands and none requests changes. --admin
              bypasses this on the merge, so the route re-checks it here.
    checks    no conflict, zero actionable unresolved threads, status checks
              configured, and every required context green on this head, taken
              from the readiness check's own required_contexts set. Where the
              base requires every conversation resolved, under either
              spelling below, EVERY unresolved thread is counted here,
              outdated ones included, because --admin bypasses that gate too.
              --admin bypasses the required-context gate on the merge, so the
              route re-checks each one here. A base that named no context
              counts every check on the head instead; a ruleset or
              branch-protection read that did not answer refuses, since a list
              never read cannot be re-checked.
    base      the head contains the base branch's current head, read from
              GitHub's compare endpoint, so a merge cannot land a branch
              behind its base
  The base branch's gates are read under both spellings GitHub enforces, its
  ruleset rules and its classic branch protection, since --admin bypasses both.
  A ruleset rule type, or a classic protection setting that is on, which the
  route neither re-checks, nor can prove harmless to a PR merge, nor can prove
  removes the bypass itself, refuses. So does an accounted one that forbids
  the merge about to be issued: a
  pull_request rule whose allowed_merge_methods excludes --squash, --merge or
  --rebase as passed, and required_linear_history in either spelling against
  --merge. An absent or empty allowed_merge_methods is every method. A base
  requiring every review conversation resolved refuses on any unresolved
  thread, outdated included, since GitHub holds the merge on all of them; the
  ruleset spells that required_review_thread_resolution and classic protection
  spells it required_conversation_resolution. A base carrying no classic
  protection is a real answer, read from GitHub's own not-protected reply; a
  protection read that fails any other way refuses, as an unread gate.
  A queued or auto-merge-armed PR is then disarmed and dequeued in
  merge-pr-restack.md step 1's order, and the merge passes the full 40-character
  --match-head-commit SHA. The base head is re-read immediately before the
  merge and a base that advanced since the containment check refuses. Where a
  disarm or a dequeue actually ran, the review, checks and base-branch gates
  above are evaluated a second time immediately before the merge, since --admin
  bypasses them and a check rerun, a dismissed approval or a new thread inside
  that mutation window leaves the head and the base unchanged; the read to the
  merge call is the one window the route cannot close, as in the fast path.

  One record line goes to stdout on every outcome, naming the PR, the head and
  each precondition's verdict, for the caller's fleet log and the PR's
  `## Merge decision` section:
    admin-merge <merged|already-merged|enrolled|unconfirmed|refused> pr=<N>
      head=<SHA> route=<..> class=<..> head-match=<..> review=<..> checks=<..>
      base=<..> dequeue=<..> [reason=<..>]
  A field no condition reached prints `-`. Exit codes: 0 merged (or already
  merged), 75 enrolled (GitHub queued or armed the PR instead of merging it),
  1 refused or the merge outcome could not be confirmed (verdict unconfirmed).
  The post-merge state comes from one GraphQL read. Where that read fails, the
  gh pr view fallback cannot see merge-queue membership, so unless it shows a
  MERGED state or an armed auto-merge the outcome is unconfirmed, never
  refused: --admin can enroll the PR rather than land it.

Force rules:
  --force and --admin skip every check, including the thread gate. --admin also
  requests GitHub's branch-protection bypass. Both are immediate-only and
  conflict with --auto. A failed override remains BLOCKED unless the exact-head
  post-state is MERGED; pending merge state is not success.

--check JSON:
  stdout is one object with these fields:
    can_merge   boolean readiness result
    issues      blocking issue strings
    warnings    non-blocking issue strings
    mergeable   MERGEABLE, CONFLICTING, or UNKNOWN
    review      GitHub review decision
    transient   true only when every blocker can clear by waiting
    state       OPEN, MERGED, CLOSED, or UNKNOWN
    merged_at   merge timestamp, or an empty string
    head_runs   run IDs used for CI classification
    checks      raw check rollup read by the classification
    required_contexts
                base-branch contexts the classification may block on
    unresolved_threads_all
                integer count of every unresolved review thread, outdated
                ones included, or null where the thread lookup failed or
                answered malformed. The admin-credential route reads it
                where the base requires every conversation resolved.

  stderr carries mergeable, blocked, merged, or closed, followed by
  head-run: <ids> when CI runs were classified. can_merge=false with an empty
  issues array means the PR is terminal; inspect state instead of treating it
  as a blocker to repair.

  transient=true requires every issue prefix to be unknown:, ci_pending:,
  ci_unconfigured:, or ci_fetch_failed:. A ci_failed: issue is permanent, as
  are conflicts and changes_requested. Running checks use ci_pending: while
  failed or cancelled checks use ci_failed:.

  ci_pending: and ci_failed: name only contexts the base branch requires, read
  from its rulesets and classic protection. A red check outside that set is a
  ci_optional_failed: warning, which blocks nothing — GitHub merges over it. A
  required context that has registered no check on the head is ci_pending:
  "<context> (missing)", the state GitHub itself is in while it waits. A base
  that requires nothing, whose protection cannot be read, or whose ruleset
  carries a rule gating the merge on a check it does not name, counts every
  check as before.

  head_runs contains the authoritative workflow run plus runs referenced by
  custom commit statuses. checks is the same snapshot consumed by
  ci-classify-refusal <N>, so cause:, fail:, and superseded: lines cannot race
  a second fetch.

Examples:
  github.sh pr-merge 42 --check          # Check only, JSON output
  github.sh pr-merge 42                  # Check + merge if pass
  github.sh pr-merge 42 --auto           # Merge now or queue auto-merge
  github.sh pr-merge 42 --force          # Explicit local override (DANGEROUS)
  github.sh pr-merge 42 --admin          # Explicit admin override (DANGEROUS)

# The base branch's required status-check contexts as a JSON array: the
# ruleset and classic-protection endpoints merge_gate_gap already reads, read
# for their context names instead of their presence. GitHub merges a PR whose
# non-required checks are red, so these names are what the CI gate may block
# on. Any answer that is not positive evidence of the whole required set
# prints `[]`, which counts every check — a branch whose protection cannot be
# read must never merge over a red one.
#
# An empty classic list counts only when the branch answer actually carried a
# `protection` object. GitHub omits that key from the branch payload for a
# caller without push access, and a missing key parses cleanly and exits 0, so
# reading it as "nothing required" would narrow the set to the ruleset
# contexts alone under a read-only token.
#
# The ruleset read also refuses on a rule type it cannot account for. Only
# `required_status_checks` names its contexts; the types listed in the filter
# below gate the ref, its commits, its files or its reviews and put nothing in
# the check rollup. `pull_request` and `copilot_code_review` are the review
# gates among them: each demands a REVIEW, which arrives as a review and is
# already carried by this command's approval and review-thread gates, never as
# a check on the head. Every other type — `workflows`, `code_scanning`,
# `code_quality`, `code_coverage` and whatever GitHub adds next — gates the
# merge on a check result whose context the rule never names, so naming a
# required set beside one would drop that check's red to a warning. An
# unrecognized type therefore turns the narrowing OFF rather than merging over
# a check the read cannot see. Rule types: docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/rules

# route neither re-checks (required_status_checks, pull_request) nor can prove
# harmless to a PR merge (the ref-shape rules below): a required merge queue,
# required deployments, required signatures, code scanning, or a future type.
# `update` is not one of the harmless ref-shape rules. It restricts updates of
# a matching ref to bypass actors, and the ref update a pull request merge
# performs is one of those updates, so it holds this route's merge exactly as
# the classic lock_branch setting does and refuses here as unhandled.
# Or its type is accounted for while the parameter that actually decides it
# forbids the merge this route is about to issue — a pull_request rule whose
# allowed_merge_methods excludes the route's method, or required_linear_history
# against the merge commit --merge creates. Allowlisting a type by name and
# discarding its parameters would bypass exactly the field that decides it.
# Or a pull_request rule sets its second deciding parameter,
# required_review_thread_resolution: GitHub then holds the merge until every
# review conversation is resolved, outdated ones included, which is wider than
# the readiness check's actionable-thread gate. That one needs the PR's thread
# count to decide, so it becomes its own objection for admin_gates to answer.
# Emits one objection per line, `unhandled:<type>`, `method:<text>` or
# `threads:<text>`, and nothing when every rule is accounted for. A read

# Eight keys are skipped, for three reasons. The route re-checks the same
# requirement elsewhere: required_status_checks through the readiness check's
# required contexts, required_pull_request_reviews through GitHub's
# reviewDecision. Or the key removes the bypass rather than being bypassed:
# enforce_admins subjects the owner credential to the very settings --admin
# would skip, so GitHub refuses the merge outright instead of letting one
# through. Or the key cannot hold a pull request merge into an existing
# branch: block_creations gates a branch's creation, allow_force_pushes,
# allow_deletions and allow_fork_syncing gate a push, a deletion and a fork
# sync, while url is the resource's own address. Nothing is skipped merely for
# being about pushes and actors, since GitHub holds a merge on several of
# those: required_signatures, lock_branch and restrictions are unhandled and
# refuse, which is also how the ruleset reader above answers their ruleset
# spellings. required_conversation_resolution and required_linear_history are
# the ruleset gates' classic spellings and emit the same two objections. Every
# other key that is on is unhandled.
# Emits one objection per line, `unhandled:<text>`, `method:<text>` or
