# Name the cause of a pr-merge refusal.
# Usage: ci-classify-refusal <PR_NUMBER>
#
# Re-runs pr-merge's safety checks and reduces the refusal to one primary
# `cause:` word, so callers route on a name instead of re-deriving the
# diagnosis from raw `gh pr checks` output (which mixes superseded runs into
# the current head's rollup and cannot be read as a merge gate).
#
# Output (stdout, one item per line):
#   cause: <word>          primary cause — fetch_error | merge_conflict |
#                          changes_requested | threads | ci_failed |
#                          ci_pending | computing | merged | closed | none.
#                          An issue prefix outside that vocabulary becomes
#                          the cause word itself, so a new pr-merge prefix
#                          names itself instead of reading as all-clear
#   issue: <raw>           every refusal issue, verbatim
#   head-run: <ids>        (ci_failed/ci_pending only) run ids the CI
#                          classification was scoped to; "none" when no
#                          run-correlated checks exist
#   fail: ...              (ci_failed only) each failing check with its
#                          state, workflow, and run id
#   superseded: ...        (ci_failed only) runs on the head whose checks
#                          were NOT counted — workflow runs (`workflow=`)
#                          and commit statuses (`status=`) alike. A status
#                          lands here when a newer same-name status
#                          replaced it, and also when it is the latest of
#                          its name but the run it links was retired by the
#                          stale-status rewrite. A failure someone read
#                          from raw `gh pr checks` output may belong here
#
# Every line reads ONE checks snapshot: pr-merge --check embeds the rollup
# it classified in its JSON (`checks`), and this script scopes that instead
# of refetching — cause:/issue: and head-run:/fail:/superseded: cannot
# describe different fetches.
#
# `cause: none` means the checks pass now: the refusal was not produced by
# these gates (or has cleared since) — re-run the refusing command.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0   classified (including cause: none)
#   1   the check run itself failed to produce parseable JSON
#   2   usage error
