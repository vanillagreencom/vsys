# Resolve the owner/name slug every `gh --repo` argument and `repos/<slug>/`
# API path carries, so one value decides which repository a command reads and
# which one it mutates.

# GH_REPO wins. `gh repo view` resolves from the working directory and ignores
# GH_REPO (gh 2.100), unlike `gh pr view` and the rest, so a caller acting on
# another repository's PR from this checkout would otherwise be handed this
# checkout's repository — and one command would split its read and its write
# across two repositories.
# With GH_REPO unset, the working directory answers: `gh repo view` first, then
# the origin remote for a checkout gh cannot resolve.
#
# Arguments: the project root whose origin remote the fallback reads.
# Stdout: the resolved slug, or the rejected candidate on exit 2.
# Exit: 0 resolved, 1 nothing resolved, 2 resolved to something that is not
# owner/name — two segments of the characters GitHub issues for an owner and a
# repository name, around a single slash.
