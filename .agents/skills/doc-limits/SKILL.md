# Doc Limits

Run the document byte-ceiling check before review and in CI. The commit-guards pre-commit and pre-push chains use the staged mode; at push the index is held equal to HEAD first, so that mode measures the tree being pushed.

```bash
.agents/skills/doc-limits/scripts/doc-limits
.agents/skills/doc-limits/scripts/doc-limits --staged
```

A load-point document over its limit fails the check; any other document over its limit warns. [references/policy.md § Path classes](references/policy.md#path-classes) names the load points.

Bring a document under its limit in the order [docs-writing § Format](../docs-writing/SKILL.md#format) gives. A document that must stay whole gets a row in the configured excludes file with its reason. The docs-writing rule for the document's class, under [§ Per file type](../docs-writing/SKILL.md#per-file-type), decides which remedy the document admits; each finding names that rule. Class selection and the exclusion format are [references/policy.md](references/policy.md). Flags, settings and exit codes are in `doc-limits --help`.
