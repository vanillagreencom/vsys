# doc-limits

A byte-size check for the Markdown documents a coding harness loads at every turn. It reports each document that exceeds its path class.

## Features

- Check document sizes against byte limits.
- Apply project limits by path pattern.
- Exclude generated files through the render inventory and other exceptions through reasoned rows.
- Check staged documents with staged policy.
- Fail the check for a document over its limit.

## Install

```bash
kendex add vanillagreencom/kendex --skill doc-limits
```

## How it works

The checker measures every tracked `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md` and `SKILL.md`, each under its first matching class. It compares the byte count with that limit and reports every oversized document. The check leaves the files and index unchanged.

## Path classes

Set `DOC_LIMITS_CLASSES` to override the limit of a measured file. Each entry uses `pattern=Nk`, with semicolons between entries. The `k` suffix means 1024 bytes. [references/policy.md](references/policy.md) defines class selection and reasoned exclusions.

## Setup

Requires Git, Bash, jq, the commit-guards skill and standard POSIX tools. Bash 3.2 is supported. The commit-guards pre-commit and pre-push hooks run the installed check.

Set project values in `kendex.settings.toml` under `[env]`. Local overrides use `.kendex/settings.toml` or `.env.local`. Process values have priority. `doc-limits --help` lists the settings and flags.
