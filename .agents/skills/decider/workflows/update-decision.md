# Update Decision

Change an existing decision when a newer one displaces it, a re-assessment keeps or changes its choice, it is withdrawn with no replacement, its reason moves to the code or principle doc it governs, or its filename no longer describes it.

| Update | When | Status becomes |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Supersede | The new decision fully replaces this one | `Superseded by [NEW_DECISION_ID]` |
| Partially supersede | The new decision replaces specific components | `Active ([COMPONENTS] → [NEW_DECISION_ID])` |
| Revisit | A re-assessment keeps the choice | `Active`, unchanged |
| Rename | The filename no longer describes the existing decision | Unchanged |
| Retire | The choice is withdrawn and nothing replaces it | `Withdrawn` |
| Remove | The choice is routine and holds; its reason now lives in the code or principle doc it governs | `Removed` |

`Retired` is the legacy spelling of `Withdrawn`. A change that touches a record for any reason rewrites its `Retired` status to `Withdrawn` in that same change: in the INDEX row, and in the decision file where one exists. A legacy retirement may have no document, its Link cell a backticked filename, or only a one-line one; the rewrite leaves that as it is and recreates no document. A row nothing touches stays valid as written.

A re-assessment that changes the choice is a new record, per `create-decision.md`, and this workflow supersedes the old one with it.

## 1. Decision file

Set `**Status**:` to the value above. For a revisit, rewrite the `**Decision**:`, `**Why**:`, `**Rejected**:` and `**Revisit when**:` lines to the re-assessed choice; the record states the current policy, and git history holds the earlier wording. For a rename, move the existing file to `[ID]-kebab-descriptor.md`; keep its ID and status, and leave no file at the old path. For a retirement, keep the significant decision's short file and add the withdrawal reason to `**Why**:`. For a removal, delete the file once § 3 has repointed every citation of it. Keep a one-line document for a removed record, the title, back-link, `**Status**:` and one `**Decision**:` line naming what it held or where its reason lives, only where a citation outside the repository needs the path.

## 2. INDEX row

Set the Status column of that decision's row to the same value. For a revisit, rewrite the Decision, Rationale and Revisit When cells with the file. For a removal, write where the reason now lives in the Rationale cell: the code path or the principle doc. For a retirement, keep the document link and state the withdrawal reason in the Rationale cell. For a removal that deletes the document, rewrite the Link cell to the backticked filename, `[Full](D0NN-x.md)` becoming `` `D0NN-x.md` ``, so no dead link remains; `decisions check` compares the filename the cell resolves to, so the record keeps its identity across branches. Never remove a row: it keeps the ID reserved. For citations outside that row, follow § 3 and [Decision Format § Decision document](../schemas/decision-format.md#decision-document).

## 3. Citations

For a rename, change the existing row's Link cell and every citation of the old filename to the new filename in the same change. Keep the ID. Run `decisions check`: it accepts a rename on either or both branches when they inherited the same record, with each renamed side's old file gone and new file present. Independently allocated IDs under different filenames remain collisions, even when both rows have the same text. Equal resolved filenames retain the same-record treatment.

Skip for a revisit. For a supersession, repoint `REVISIT([DECISION_ID])` comments at the new ID; for a partial supersession, only those covering the superseded components. For a retirement or a removal, find every citation of the ID and of the document's file name by a literal search for both, in code, docs and `AGENTS.md`; a sibling record's `[ID](ID-descriptor.md)` link is one. A removal's citations point at the reason's new home: the comment at the code or the principle doc's section. A retirement's historical citations keep pointing at its retained document. Remove active-policy citations and `REVISIT` markers; keep a comment at the site only where the code still needs the reason.
