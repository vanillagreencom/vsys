## Sizes

Choose the smallest size that covers the scope; promote a bold-label field to an `##` section once it outgrows a line.

| Size | Lines | Scope | Adds to the skeleton |
|------|-------|-------|----------------------|
| Minimal | 15-30 | One choice, clear winner | Nothing |
| Standard | 80-200 | Alternatives weighed, pattern worth documenting | `## Summary`, `## Pattern`, a comparison table, `## Decision Criteria` (when to use the chosen approach vs the alternative), `## Alternatives Considered` (alternative → why rejected) |
| Comprehensive | 200-600 | Architecture-level, several concerns | The above plus `## Requirements`, `## Design` subsections, `## Impact` (which other decisions change and why), `## Resolved Decisions`, `## Appendices`, and the optional `**Applies to**` / `**Refines**` / `**API Contract**` metadata lines |

The document stays a summary; link research for the full analysis. Code blocks name their language; cross-references are markdown links.
