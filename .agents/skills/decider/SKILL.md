# Decider

Numbered decision documents indexed in one `INDEX.md` (default `docs/decisions/`), with a search CLI, canonical format, and creation/supersession workflows.

```bash
.agents/skills/decider/scripts/decisions <command> [options]
```

Actions (`search`, `search --issue`, `list`, `next-id`, `get`, `check`), search coverage and scoring, output shapes, and the `DECISIONS_DIR` / `DECISIONS_BASE_REF` / `DECISION_ID_*` environment: `decisions --help`. There is no bare `issue` action; use `search --issue`.

Read a hit's INDEX row first. Read an active or superseded record's document before treating it as binding. When considering a withdrawn option, read its retained document and withdrawal reason. A removed record's reason lives where its Rationale cell names it, the comment at the code or the principle doc's section. An active decision binds design policy; a suggestion contradicting it is invalid unless the decision itself is flawed. One marked superseded binds only what its status leaves active; a withdrawn one binds nothing; a removed one binds through the code or principle doc its INDEX row names.

## What warrants a decision record, and why

A record exists to stop a reversal: a reviewer or a future agent, reading the code alone, would undo the choice because the code cannot show its reason. Judge the reach and the reason, not the number of sites.

Warranted:

- A choice that governs work beyond one site: one merge path for every repository; every removal goes to the trash and nothing deletes.
- A choice a reviewer or a future agent would otherwise reverse: a hand-written WebSocket client kept over a dependency, in a catalog that ships standard-library scripts.
- A choice whose reason the code cannot show: a bound set below a measured incident, with the measurement as its reason.

Not warranted:

- A local implementation choice: a lock taken before a cleanup is registered is a comment at the code.
- A restated convention: shell stays Bash 3.2 compatible is an `AGENTS.md` line.
- A choice no one would revisit: a file format version field, a naming scheme.
- A record of what was done: git history holds it.

A record is short: the choice, why, the main rejected alternative, the revisit trigger, with its ID, status, issue or evidence link and partial-supersession scope. Shortening a record keeps its ID and status; moving a reason into code is not a reversal. A record whose choice is routine is removed once its reason lives in the code or principle doc it governs: removal is not withdrawal and changes no policy. A withdrawal with no replacement is a retirement. Follow `workflows/update-decision.md`: retain a significant withdrawn decision's short document with status `Withdrawn` and the withdrawal reason; remove a routine record's document after moving its reason. Keep the INDEX row in both cases so the ID stays reserved. Supersede only changed policy.

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| `workflows/create-decision.md` | A choice under the bar above is settled |
| `workflows/update-decision.md` | A new decision supersedes, partially supersedes, or revisits an existing one, or an existing one is retired or removed |

Format: `schemas/decision-format.md` (constraints), `templates/decision-entry.md` (document skeleton), `templates/index-row.md` (INDEX row). The finished example is the docs-writing skill's `examples/decision.md`.

## Approval

Never create a decision document without explicit user approval. When work settles a choice under the bar, say on completion: "this introduced a decision worth recording: [summary]. Want me to create a decision entry?"
