# Decision Format

Canonical constraints for decision documents and their index.

# Architectural Decision Log

| Date | ID | Research | Decision | Rationale | Revisit When | Status | Link |
|------|----|----------|----------|-----------|--------------|--------|------|
```

Column order is a machine contract: the `decisions` CLI selects rows starting `| YYYY-MM-DD |` and reads the eight cells positionally. The Link cell must name the decision document. Rows are append-only, never re-sorted. Row format: `../templates/index-row.md`.

Below the table: a Format Reference section listing what to log, what not to log, and the status values in use.

## Decision document

File name `[DECISION_ID]-kebab-case-descriptor.md` — `D001-session-caching.md`, `ADR-0001-runtime-choice.md`. A `DECISION_ID` is a prefix plus numeric suffix; a project keeps one scheme (`D001` by default; keep `ADR-0001` where established).

| Element | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Title | `# [DECISION_ID]: Title` |
| Index back-link | `[← Decision Index](INDEX.md)`, immediately after the title |
| Date | `**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD` |
| Status | `**Status**: [VALUE]` — see below |
| Research | `**Research**: [REF]`, or `—` when none |
| Decision | What was chosen, stated explicitly |
| Rationale | Why — bullets, table, or section |
| Revisit When | Conditions for re-evaluation |

Optional metadata lines: `**Applies to**:` (scoped decisions), `**Refines**:` (extends prior decisions), `**API Contract**:` (defines or changes one). Optional sections: `## Summary`, `## Context`, `## Pattern`, `## Verification`, `## Alternatives Considered`, `## Impact`, `## Appendices`.

## Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Active` | In effect — the default for a new decision |
| `Active ([COMPONENTS] → [DECISION_ID])` | Partially superseded: the named components only |
| `Superseded by [DECISION_ID]` | Fully replaced |
| `Revisited` | Re-evaluated, outcome recorded in the document |

`list` returns every decision whose status starts with `Active`, including partial supersessions.
