# Architectural Decision Log

| Date | ID | Research | Decision | Rationale | Revisit When | Status | Link |
|------|----|----------|----------|-----------|--------------|--------|------|
```

Column order is a machine contract: the `decisions` CLI selects rows starting `| YYYY-MM-DD |` and reads the eight cells positionally. The Link cell names the record's document: as a link, `[Full](D0NN-x.md)`, while the document exists, and as the backticked filename (`` `D0NN-x.md` ``) once it is gone, so no dead link stays in a scope the commit-guards md-refs lane judges. `decisions check` compares the filename the cell resolves to, not the cell as written, so the record keeps its identity across branches through either form. Rows are append-only, never re-sorted or removed: `next-id` allocates past the highest ID in the index and on the base branch, so a deleted row would free its ID for an unrelated choice. Row format: `../templates/index-row.md`.

Below the table: a Format Reference section with one link to this schema and one to the bar, the decider `SKILL.md` § What warrants a decision record, and why. It copies nothing from either.

## Decision document

File name `[DECISION_ID]-kebab-case-descriptor.md` — `D001-session-caching.md`, `ADR-0001-runtime-choice.md`. A `DECISION_ID` is a prefix plus numeric suffix; a project keeps one scheme (`D001` by default; keep `ADR-0001` where established).

An active, superseded or withdrawn significant record has a short document. A withdrawn record keeps the choice and its reason, with status `Withdrawn` and the reason for withdrawal in `**Why**:`. A removed routine record has no document, except a one-line document kept where a citation outside the repository needs the path: the title, the back-link, `**Status**:` and one `**Decision**:` line. The commit-guards md-refs lane permits an ID with no tracked document only within that ID's own INDEX row. A citation elsewhere needs a tracked decision document or a link to the rule's current home.

| Element | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Title | `# [DECISION_ID]: Title` |
| Index back-link | `[← Decision Index](INDEX.md)`, immediately after the title |
| Date | `**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD` |
| Status | `**Status**: [VALUE]` — see below |
| Research | `**Research**: [REF]`: the issue or evidence link, or `—` when none |
| Decision | `**Decision**:` what was chosen, stated explicitly |
| Why | `**Why**:` the constraints, accepted costs and material consequences the code cannot show; for a withdrawn decision, also the reason for withdrawal |
| Rejected | `**Rejected**:` the main alternative and why it lost |
| Revisit when | `**Revisit when**:` the condition that re-opens the choice |

Optional metadata lines, each one line: `**Supersedes**:` or `**Refines**:` naming the earlier decision and the scope taken from it, and `**Applies to**:` for a scoped decision. Nothing else: no summary, context, design, verification, impact or appendix section. A measurement, a test name or a run order belongs to the issue, the test or the code.

Each `**Key**: value` line, metadata included, is its own paragraph, with one blank line before the next: `../templates/decision-entry.md`.

## Status values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `Active` | In effect — the default for a new decision |
| `Active ([COMPONENTS] → [DECISION_ID])` | Partially superseded: the named components only |
| `Superseded by [DECISION_ID]` | Fully replaced |
| `Withdrawn` | No longer in effect, with no replacement; keep the short document and withdrawal reason, and its INDEX link |
| `Retired` | The legacy spelling of `Withdrawn`: same meaning; write `Withdrawn` in new and updated records. A legacy retirement may have no document, its Link cell a backticked filename, or only a one-line one, and keeps that form when rewritten |
| `Removed` | The choice holds; its reason lives in the code or principle doc the Rationale cell names, and the row alone keeps the ID reserved, its Link cell following § INDEX.md |

A re-assessment that keeps the choice stays `Active` with its text rewritten; one that changes the choice is a new record that supersedes this one (`../workflows/update-decision.md`). `list` returns every decision whose status starts with `Active`, including partial supersessions.

## Cross-references

| From → to | Format |
|-----------|--------|
| Decision → decision | `[DECISION_ID](DECISION_ID-descriptor.md)` |
| Decision → issue or evidence | the tracker link, or the attachment on that issue |
| Decision → code | `` `path/to/file.rs` `` or a relative link |
| Code → decision | `// REVISIT([DECISION_ID]): [reason]`, only where that code carries out the choice |
| Code → removed decision | the reason as a comment at the code, or a `<path>.md § Heading` citation of the principle doc |
| Issue → decision | `**Decision [DECISION_ID]**: [path/to/DECISION_ID-descriptor.md]` |
