# Body-scoped decision search.
#
# `decisions search` reads the decision document itself, not only the INDEX.md
# summary columns (decision, rationale, id). A search over the summary alone
# returns `[]` for a keyword that appears only in a decision's prose —
# indistinguishable from "no decision governs this area", the opposite of the
# truth — and that silently passes the pre-mutation guards that call this
# search (orch review-pr § 1.1, dev-fix § 2, tpm-audit § 2, and the issue
# template).
#
# Pinned here: the body match and the ranking contract: body matches surface
# BELOW every summary match, so a summary match keeps its position and score
# rather than being displaced by a body match.
