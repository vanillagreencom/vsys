#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Shared project configuration loader for kendex skill scripts.
#
# Sources, lowest to highest precedence among project files:
#   1. kendex.settings.toml, then .kendex/settings.toml ([env] table only)
#   2. the project's private env file, .env.local unless KENDEX_ENV_FILE
#      names another
# The caller's own environment outranks every project file —
# kendex_load_project_env snapshots and re-asserts it. A `.env` file is
# never read; shared settings belong in kendex.settings.toml, personal and
# secret overrides in the private env file.
#
# KENDEX_ENV_FILE is the one setting that decides which file is read
# rather than what a value is, so it is resolved after the settings load
# and before the private file. It is a path relative to the project root:
# an absolute path, a `..` segment, a backslash or a colon fails the load
# rather than reading a file outside the project. It is the same key the
# app writes when a person names a private file, so one project names one
# file once, and the app's own checks — that git does not track or carry
# the file — are what make writing a credential there safe.
#
# The TOML reader accepts the kendex settings contract and nothing else:
#
#   [env]
#   WORKTREE_BASE_DIR = "../trees"
#   ORCH_STATE_DIR = "tmp"
#
# Assignments outside [env] belong to other tools and are ignored. Inside
# [env], a duplicate key or a value in any shape other than a single-line
# double-quoted string with no `"` and no `\` (an optional trailing `#`
# comment allowed) is a configuration error that fails the load — both
# resolver families read exactly this shape, so a value either decodes
# identically everywhere or fails loud here. Headers are held to the same
# standard: a line starting with `[` must be a lone `[name]` header, and
# any other `[`-leading shape fails the load — headers decide which
# assignments load, so one this reader cannot parse must never pass as an
# ignorable line. A file that begins with a UTF-8 byte-order mark is
# refused the same way: the BOM is neither whitespace nor `[` nor a key
# character, so the first header or assignment would silently misclassify.

# Parent-process env snapshot (name/value pairs). Bash 3.2 (macOS system
# bash) has no associative arrays, so the snapshot is a pair of parallel
# indexed arrays scanned linearly. Populated only by kendex_load_project_env;
# the guarded expansion below keeps standalone kendex_load_settings_file calls
# working when the snapshot was never taken (empty-array expansion is an
# unbound variable under Bash 3.2 with set -u).

# Callers preserve positional values for this diagnostic catalog.

# back to its main checkout so every worktree shares one credential file,
