# `[bot-instructions]`

The `[bot-instructions]` table holds repo context, enabled bots, exclusions, path instructions and doctrine overrides. It belongs in the effective kendex manifest, beside `[skill-instructions]` and `[agent-additional-instructions]`.

The generator reads `kendex.toml`. When that file declares `is_source_catalog = true`, it reads all bot settings from `kendex-local.toml` instead. It does not merge the two tables. This selection also applies when `derive_render` is false. The same resolved manifest supplies derived exclusions. `tests/staged.test.sh` checks that staged configuration, selection and outputs use the same index.

The bot schema is closed within this table. Unknown keys, unknown child tables and wrong value types fail `toml-schema`. Other manifest tables are outside this schema. `tests/toml-schema.test.sh` checks this boundary. Rust preserves the TOML values through manifest and app reads and writes; the package owns bot validation.

## The glob dialect

One pattern is written once and handed to Copilot's comma-separated `applyTo`, CodeRabbit's minimatch and `git sparse-checkout`, Qodo's `[ignore]`, and Macroscope's `include`. Those engines agree on very little, so the file accepts only what all of them read the same way.

**Allowed characters, and nothing else:** the printable ASCII path characters `A-Z a-z 0-9 . _ - /` plus the four metacharacters `*`, `?`, `[`, `]`. `**` is the two-character form of `*`. Every other byte is refused, which covers a newline, a tab, any other control character, leading or trailing whitespace, and `#`.

Stating the dialect as a character class rather than as a list of banned sequences is deliberate. A glob is rendered into files whose grammars are line-oriented or comment-bearing: one holding a newline becomes two lines in `.macroscope/ignore.md`, where every line is a pattern, so a second line reading `**` takes the whole repo out of Macroscope's review while each line on its own is a valid glob and every validator passes. One holding `#` becomes a comment in `.coderabbit.yaml`. A ban list closes the shapes someone thought of; a character class closes the rest.

**Path shape, on top of the class.** Refused: an empty glob, a leading `/`, a trailing `/`, a `..` component, and an empty component. Each is its own clause, so each ships its own control.

The class catches none of them. `.` and `/` are both permitted characters, so `../**` and `/src/**` are made of nothing but allowed bytes; and the class constrains which characters may appear rather than requiring one to, so `""` satisfies it and everything else stated here.

Why each matters. A `..` component is a path escape in the one place this package hands its own strings to a checkout tool, since `path_filters` reaches `git sparse-checkout`. A leading `/` is an anchoring form the engines read differently. An empty glob means something different to each of the five, so it renders as a pattern whose effect is undefined and engine-dependent — the silent failure this package exists to remove.

The metacharacters the class leaves out are worth naming for the error message: a brace (`{`, `}`), extglob (`!(`, `@(`, `+(`, `?(`, `*(`), a comma, a backslash, a leading `!`, and a double quote. A comma because Copilot's `applyTo` splits on it and CodeRabbit's multi-glob join uses braces; the rest because at least one engine reads them differently from the others, and a pattern that means two things is worse than one that is rejected.

An empty glob list is an error wherever a glob list is required, which is the list-level counterpart of the empty-glob clause above.

## Keys

### `[bot-instructions] schema`

Integer, required. `1`. The generator refuses a value it does not know rather than rendering a partly understood file.

### `[bot-instructions.repo]`

| Key | Type | Required | Meaning |
|-----|------|----------|---------|
| `name` | string | yes | The repo's own name, used in generated file headers. One line, `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` only, because it renders as a `#` heading line |
| `summary` | string | yes | What this repo is, in two to six sentences. Rendered near the top of the Copilot and Qodo surfaces, which is the only place a bot learns the shape of the codebase |
| `tracker` | string | no | Issue prefix, e.g. `KEN`. Substituted into the `reply-contract` block's `<issue>` placeholder, so it reaches every destination that block does, `.pr_agent.toml` included. Its character class in the table below is what keeps it safe in all of them. Absent leaves the placeholder generic, which a repo guard pinning the tracked reply form reads as the form being gone |

`summary` is prose about this repo, not doctrine. Anything in it that would be true of another repo belongs in a doctrine block instead. It is under the same content refusals as `[[bot-instructions.surface]] instructions`; the table below says which those are, for every string this package renders into a structured file.

### `[bot-instructions.bots]`

Booleans, each defaulting to `false`, one per capability rather than one per vendor. A vendor name covers products with different file support and different portal toggles, and a single flag would render authoritative-looking files that reach nothing.

| Key | Renders |
|-----|---------|
| `codex` | the `AGENTS.md` section, which is the doctrine root rather than a Codex-only file |
| `copilot` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` |
| `coderabbit` | `.coderabbit.yaml` |
| `qodo` | `.pr_agent.toml` |
| `qodo_best_practices` | `best_practices.md`. Automatic loading of that file is Qodo Merge, the commercial product; open-source PR-Agent does not read it |
| `qodo_review_md` | `REVIEW.md`. Inert until the portal's "REVIEW.md instructions" toggle is on, which is why it is a flag someone sets after doing the checklist line rather than something the generator infers |
| `macroscope` | the `.macroscope/` tree |

**Every flag false is not an error.** A TOML that enables nothing has nothing to render, and that is a state worth holding: it is how a repo commits its `[bot-instructions]` in the repo-wide pass of `references/checklist.md` § Adding a repo, before its settings work has enabled anything, and how a fleet stages a rollout one bot at a time. The default being `false` is what makes that the safe direction — a minimal TOML writes no file the repo did not ask for. `render` says it wrote nothing rather than exiting quietly, so an operator who expected files learns the flags are off; rendering nothing in silence would be the thing this package exists to prevent. Having nothing to render is not the same as a render that cannot stop: `agents-section`'s nested-`AGENTS.md` clause is gated by no flag and runs before every write, so an all-off render still fails on a repo holding such a section. `references/checklist.md` § Adding a repo makes clearing one a pass-one step for that reason.

What is an error is a flag combination where something enabled reaches nothing. Three of those, all enforced by `toml-schema`:

- `qodo_best_practices` or `qodo_review_md` true with `qodo` false.
- `copilot` or `coderabbit` true with `codex` false. Both read the `AGENTS.md` section: CodeRabbit through `knowledge_base.code_guidelines.filePatterns`, Copilot code review directly on GitHub.com. Without it, `.coderabbit.yaml` carries one doctrine block and the Copilot file's reply-contract pointer aims at a section that does not exist, and both render clean.
- A non-empty `[[bot-instructions.surface]]` set with `copilot`, `coderabbit`, `macroscope` and `qodo_best_practices` all false. Those four are every route surface text has, so the surfaces would be instructions nothing reads.

Turning a capability off renders none of its files and deletes none of them, so the files this package wrote stay active until someone removes them. Deleting them is the same commit's work and it comes first: `render` fails on an orphan rather than creating one, so the order is delete, then flip the flag and render. `check` is what catches a retirement that skipped the render. `validators.md` § `orphan` carries the order. A file at one of those paths that this package never wrote is the repo's own and is not judged: `adopt` is how one becomes managed, and it needs the capability on.

### `[bot-instructions.cadence]`

| Key | Type | Default | Renders to |
|-----|------|---------|------------|
| `coderabbit_incremental` | bool | `true` | `reviews.auto_review.auto_incremental_review` |
| `coderabbit_drafts` | bool | `false` | `reviews.auto_review.drafts` |
| `qodo_commands` | array of string | `["/agentic_review"]` | `[github_app] pr_commands` |
| `qodo_push_trigger` | bool | `false` | `[github_app] handle_push_trigger` |

Each `qodo_commands` entry is a bare verb from this set, which is the one statement of it — `qodo-parity` reads the review half rather than carrying a copy:

| Verb | Line | Role |
|------|------|------|
| `/agentic_review` | Review | review |
| `/review` | Merge | review |
| `/agentic_describe` | Review | not review |
| `/describe` | Merge | not review |
| `/improve` | Merge | not review |

`qodo-parity` requires guidance in the section a **review** verb reads, and this render writes it for both. A verb in the other half reads a section this render leaves alone by design — `/agentic_describe` and `/describe` write the pull request body, `/improve` reads `[pr_code_suggestions]` — so the parity clause does not apply to it and its presence is not a finding. Splitting by role rather than narrowing the set is what keeps the vendor's own documented default, `["/agentic_describe", "/agentic_review"]`, from being a schema error.

No whitespace and no `--` in an entry. A `pr_commands` entry carries inline `--section.key=value` overrides, which is how Qodo's own examples are written, so `/review --pr_reviewer.extra_instructions=""` would null the guidance the render just wrote while `qodo-parity` passed: that validator compares the two sections against each other and never reads a command line. Refusing the override form at input is cheaper than teaching a validator to parse it.

First-push-only cadence is `coderabbit_incremental = false` with `qodo_push_trigger = false`: neither bot re-reviews on push, and a reviewer is summoned by comment at a batch boundary. It is the setting that decides how many rounds a pull request costs, so it is a per-repo choice rather than a doctrine constant, and no doctrine block asserts what a push triggers.

### `[bot-instructions.tone]`

`coderabbit`, string, optional. Renders to `tone_instructions`, whose hard cap is 250 characters after the generator strips the newlines a TOML multi-line string introduces. Over the cap, CodeRabbit rejects the entire file. The cap counts Unicode code points, which is what the vendored schema's `maxLength` counts. Absent, the shipped default is used; see `renders.md` for its text.

### `[bot-instructions.retention]`

`coderabbit`, bool, default `true`. What CodeRabbit keeps between pull requests. `false` renders `knowledge_base.opt_out = true`, which removes its stored learnings and its issue and pull request context; code guidelines and web search are stateless and stay on. A repo whose checked-in policy is complete sets it `false` so no learning accumulated in chat shadows the policy.

### `[bot-instructions.budgets]`

| Key | Type | Default | Bounds |
|-----|------|---------|--------|
| `copilot_chars` | integer | `6000` | the rendered `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, in characters |
| `qodo_best_practices_lines` | integer | `800` | the rendered `best_practices.md`, in lines |

Both are package budgets rather than vendor caps, and they are the same kind of thing: GitHub documents no numeric cap and asks for "no longer than 2 pages", Qodo recommends keeping a best-practices file under about 800 lines and states no length at which it rejects or truncates one. `references/limits.md` carries each recommendation and marks the budget built on it. Raise one in a repo whose surfaces genuinely need more, and say why in a comment.

The vendor caps this package can reach — `tone_instructions` at 250 characters and a `path_instructions` entry at 20,000 — take no key. They are the vendored CodeRabbit schema's own `maxLength`, so `coderabbit-schema` is their single enforcer and nothing here carries a second copy of either number.

### `[bot-instructions.exclusions]`

`derive_render`, bool, default `false`. When true, the generator reads kendex's writer inventory and the repo's install manifest and adds every rendered harness tree to the exclusion set. What it derives is exactly two things: each `.agents/skills/<name>` tree the inventory `.kendex-generated.json` lists a path under, and each **immediate subdirectory holding a tracked path** of each per-harness render root the repo's install declares. The inventory is the record kendex tracks of the files it wrote, so a skill kendex installs as another skill's dependency is derived without a `[skills.<name>]` row. A skill declared `in-place` is this repo's own file; kendex lists none of its paths, so it stays in review scope. The tracked-path condition is what keeps a derivation and the dead-exclusion clause from contradicting each other: a subtree the install has not produced, or one git ignores, excludes nothing, and deriving it would name a glob that clause rejects with no edit an author could make to clear it. A render root the index holds as an entry of its own — staged as a symlink, or as a file — is refused naming that root rather than derived as an empty set, because git stores such a root as one entry with the tree under its real name and an empty derivation would leave that tree in review scope silently. A derived glob is held to the glob dialect like a declared one, and an inventory path component or directory name outside it fails naming the inventory entry or manifest row that produced it: this is the one glob source no author writes as a glob, and the paths render as prose on the two surfaces that read them as prose, where nothing would judge them as patterns at all.

**A harness root is never derived whole**, and the subdirectory rule is why. A harness root holds two kinds of thing: subdirectories the harness install owns whole, and root-level files it merges its own entries into while the repo owns the rest — `.claude/settings.json`, `.codex/config.toml`, `.pi/settings.json`, and the repo's own memory file beside them. Excluding the root would silence bot review on files this repo actually owns and can fix, which is the opposite of what the derivation is for: it exists to keep vendored render output out of review, not to hide hand-maintained config. `skills/review-gate/references/vendored-paths.md` § The harness-render variant draws the same line for the review gate's own set and names the merged paths.

One harness root is the repo's own directory rather than the harness's: Copilot's is `.github`, where the install owns `agents`, `hooks` and `skills` and the repo owns everything else. That row names its subtrees instead of taking the root. A harness the generator has no row for is an error rather than a guessed root, because guessing wrong there is the silenced-settings-file failure above.

**The manifest is the one kendex resolves, never a hardcoded filename.** That is `kendex.toml`, except in a repo whose `kendex.toml` declares `is_source_catalog = true`, where install state routes to the sibling `kendex-local.toml` and `kendex.toml` holds the published catalog with no install tables at all. kendex's own repo is such a catalog. A generator that opened `kendex.toml` by name there would parse a present, valid file, derive an empty set, exclude none of the rendered trees, and pass its own consistency check comparing empty against empty — the exact silent failure this package exists to remove.

**A resolved manifest that declares no install is an error**, not an empty derivation. So is a missing or unparseable one, and so is an absent or unreadable `.kendex-generated.json`: a repo kendex has not rendered into has no record to derive from. Either way the render produces nothing, the hand-written exclusions included, because a repo the generator cannot derive from should say so rather than ship a short list.

`derive_render` makes both manifests and the inventory render inputs, because the root file is read to decide where the install state lives, the sibling only when it says so, and the inventory for the skill trees. SKILL.md § The render inputs states the set; the marker names each by the path actually read.

**A derived entry's reason is fixed, and this is the only place it is written:**

> harness render output, owned upstream — a defect here is fixed at the source and arrives by re-render

Every derived entry carries that exact string, because every derived entry is excluded for that one reason and nothing about the tree distinguishes them. A render rule that wants a reason takes it from here rather than restating it, and the string is a single ASCII line with no `-->` and no `#`, so it satisfies every constraint a rendered comment is under by construction rather than by check. Without it the render rules would demand bytes the schema never supplies: `reason` is a required key on `[[bot-instructions.exclusions.path]]` entries alone, and a derived entry has no TOML row to carry one.

`[[bot-instructions.exclusions.path]]` entries add repo-specific paths.

| Key | Type | Required | Meaning |
|-----|------|----------|---------|
| `glob` | string | yes | A pattern in the dialect above |
| `reason` | string | yes | Why this path is not reviewable. Rendered as a comment beside the entry on the surfaces whose render rules say so |

A reason is required because an exclusion with no stated reason is indistinguishable from a mistake at the next read. That argument covers derived entries too, which is why they carry the fixed string above rather than nothing; what they do not have is a TOML row, so the required key stays on `[[bot-instructions.exclusions.path]]` and the generator supplies the rest.

### `[[bot-instructions.surface]]`

A path set plus what a reviewer needs to know about it. Zero or more.

| Key | Type | Required | Meaning |
|-----|------|----------|---------|
| `name` | string | yes | Lowercase, `[a-z0-9-]`, non-empty, unique. Becomes the generated filenames |
| `globs` | array of string | yes | Non-empty. Paths this surface covers |
| `exclude_globs` | array of string | no | Subtracted from `globs`, and real subtraction only on Macroscope. Kept rather than cut: it is the only path-scoped subtraction any of the five bots offers a repo file, and losing it would leave narrowing `globs` as the only tool. Everywhere else it renders as prose asking a bot to disregard rules it has already loaded, which SKILL.md says plainly rather than dressing up |
| `reviewer_only` | bool | no, default `false` | Renders `excludeAgent: "cloud-agent"` into the Copilot file, keeping reviewer doctrine away from the working agent. The other permitted value, `code-review`, hides the file from the reviewer instead, so `renders.md` fixes which one is written |
| `instructions` | string | yes | What a reviewer gets wrong here, and what is true instead |

`name` may not be `doctrine`, `correctness`, `ignore`, or `approvability`. Each is a path this package or Macroscope already governs, and a surface claiming one would silently lose a file to write order. `.macroscope/correctness/correctness.md` is the one worth naming: it is Macroscope's governing file, carrying `waitsFor`, `requires` and their two timeouts for the whole correctness run, and the render writes no frontmatter key but `include` and `exclude`, so an `adopt` over it would drop a repo's check prerequisites for good. A `name` colliding with another surface is an error. There is no separate check for a path collision, because the name **is** the generated filename: uniqueness plus the reserved set decides it, and a second check could never red.

`instructions` is under the heading, marker and control refusals below. Each restructures at least one output: a heading — `#` or an underline — ends the `AGENTS.md` owned region or forges a section, and the marker decides which files this package owns. It is also required to be non-empty, which is a rule about the surface rather than about the string: whitespace renders a `path_instructions` entry with no text, a `.instructions.md` carrying a marker and nothing under it, and a best-practices section with no body — a surface that costs its bots a read and tells them nothing. Drop the surface instead.

A `[...]` class is made of permitted characters and is not itself checked character by character, so the dialect admits one shape no engine can compile: a reversed range like `[z-a]`. `globs.check` proves the pattern compiles as its last clause, which makes that a `toml-schema` finding naming the glob rather than a traceback out of a validator much later. Consecutive `**/` are collapsed to one before matching — `**/**/` covers exactly what `**/` covers, and nesting the translation of `**/` is exponential in the number of them, which is a runtime the dead-exclusion clause pays once per tracked path.

## The content refusals

One row per input string, one column per refusal class, and an **Enforced** column saying which side reads that row's value. Every class here is one that would break the STRUCTURE of a file this package emits; a value this package merely dislikes is not refused. Everything that judges these — `toml-schema` and the Escaping paragraphs in `renders.md` — cites this table rather than restating it, so a predicate written here is the only predicate. Three structures encode it, one per kind of cell: `refusals.ROWS` holds the eight rows whose refusals are content classes, `globs.check` holds the glob row, whose character class and path-shape clauses are its own, and `config._cadence` holds the `qodo_commands` row. A reader counting clauses off this table lands on those three, and `tests/toml-schema.test.sh` holds the table against them so a row added on one side without the other reds.

The Enforced column exists because one row is not in `[bot-instructions]` at all. Doctrine block text lives in the spec copy, so `toml-schema` never sees it and cannot be the clause's owner; the render-side check is. Without the column a reader counting `toml-schema`'s clauses off this table would count three that nothing there implements.

| Input string | heading | marker | comment-close | toml-delimiter | control | character class | Enforced |
|--------------|---------|--------|---------------|----------------|---------|-----------------|----------|
| `[bot-instructions.repo] name` | – | yes | – | yes | yes | single line | `toml-schema` |
| `[bot-instructions.repo] tracker` | – | yes | – | yes | yes | single line | `toml-schema` |
| `[bot-instructions.repo] summary` | yes | yes | – | yes | yes | – | `toml-schema` |
| `[[bot-instructions.surface]] instructions` | yes | yes | – | – | yes | – | `toml-schema` |
| `[bot-instructions.doctrine.append]` / `[bot-instructions.doctrine.replace]` values | yes | yes | – | yes | yes | – | `toml-schema` |
| doctrine block text | yes | yes | – | yes | yes | – | render-side |
| `[[bot-instructions.exclusions.path]] reason` | – | yes | yes | – | yes | single line | `toml-schema` |
| `[[bot-instructions.surface]] globs`, `exclude_globs`, `[[bot-instructions.exclusions.path]] glob` | – | – | – | – | – | non-empty, the glob dialect above, and its path-shape rule | `toml-schema` |
| `[bot-instructions.tone] coderabbit` | – | – | – | – | yes | – | `toml-schema` |
| `[bot-instructions.cadence] qodo_commands` entries | – | – | – | – | – | a verb from the set above, no whitespace, no `--` | `toml-schema` |

The predicates, written once:

- **heading** — a line markdown reads as a heading, in **either** of the two forms `scripts/lib/markdown.py` states. ATX is one to six `#` after three or fewer leading spaces, followed by a space, a tab, or the end of the line. Wide about the indentation, because a line indented two spaces ends the `AGENTS.md` owned region as surely as one in column zero and a narrower input rule would pass a value the render then refuses. Exact about the delimiter, in both directions: `#1917` is a heading to no reader, and refusing it here made a doctrine block carrying a pull request number unrenderable, while `##` before a no-break space is a heading to no reader either and reading it as one ended the owned region early. Setext is a run of `=` or of `-`, indented at most three spaces with only whitespace after it, **under a non-blank line** — `Injected` over `===` is an H1 to every CommonMark reader. This half is wide on purpose: it does not ask whether the line above is a paragraph or the opener of a fenced block, because a refusal that is too wide costs an author a rewrite while one that is too narrow puts a structural heading into a generated file. The section terminators read ATX alone and `markdown.py` says why; what makes that safe is this row, which keeps a setext underline out of every string they parse.
- **marker** — a line carrying the marker text, which is what decides which files this package owns.
- **comment-close** — `-->`, which would end the HTML comment a `reason` is rendered inside and put the rest of the value on a line of its own.
- **toml-delimiter** — `"""`, which would end the TOML multi-line string the value is rendered inside. `.pr_agent.toml` carries every doctrine block and `[bot-instructions.repo] summary` as basic multi-line strings, so a value holding the delimiter closes its own string and the rest of it becomes TOML. Marked on exactly the values that reach a TOML string; `[[bot-instructions.surface]] instructions` reaches Qodo through `best_practices.md`, which is markdown.
- **control** — any C0 control character other than tab and newline, DEL (`U+007F`), and the three characters above that range a reader still breaks a line on: `U+0085` NEL, `U+2028` LINE SEPARATOR and `U+2029` PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR. One predicate for both structured targets, because the values reaching them are the same set: a TOML basic multi-line string permits tab and newline and no other control, and so does a YAML scalar. TOML's own escapes are how one arrives — `summary = "\u0000"` parses cleanly and yields a literal NUL — so the value is already decoded by the time this sees it.

  The three above C0 are in the class for the same reason the C0 ones are, one layer out: YAML 1.1 lists them as line breaks and every reader CodeRabbit's file reaches acts on them. A value carrying one is emitted as a single line here and read as two there, so a rendered `reason` comment becomes a `path_filters:` key of its own and the entry below it loses its `!` — the state `renders.md` § `reviews.path_filters` names as the one that turns the exclusion list into an allowlist. `scripts/lib/refusals.py` is the one statement of the class, and `coderabbit-schema` runs that same predicate over the document it validates: a default in the vendored schema reaches a rendered file through no row of this table.

  A `single line` class does not exempt a row from this mark: it refuses the line breaks and says nothing about the rest of the class — NUL, DEL, the C0 controls that break no line. Read the test against each class rather than counting the rows that have one.

- **character class** — as stated per row above. `single line` on `[bot-instructions.repo] name`, `[bot-instructions.repo] tracker` and `[[bot-instructions.exclusions.path]] reason`; the dialect's own class on the globs; a verb from a closed literal set on `qodo_commands`. Tab and newline stay legal in `[bot-instructions.tone] coderabbit`: the documented way to author a tone is a TOML multi-line string, and the render collapses its newlines to single spaces.

**Refusals, not escapes.** Every class here is refused at input. The render escapes only what a format requires of text already known to be legal — a backslash in a TOML basic string — and rewrites nothing else. An escape for one of these would mean the generator silently altering an author's words to make them fit a file, which is worse than telling the author the words do not fit.

**Render-side second checks.** The `doctrine block text` row is enforced where that value is read — when the generator parses the `## Doctrine` section — and it carries **every** class the row marks, not the heading class alone. Doctrine text does not come through this file, so no input refusal covers it, and each of the three markdown classes is reachable on its own route: a heading line ends the `AGENTS.md` owned region at the next render, and an underline under a text line renders into `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, where blocks are `###` subsections with paragraphs preserved, forging a section in the one file whose Escaping paragraph exists so a repo string cannot forge one; a line that is exactly `---` opens frontmatter where a block reaches byte 0; and the marker text would forge ownership of a file the repo wrote. Doctrine text reaches no `.instructions.md` file on any route — the routing table gives it eight destinations and that is not one of them — so nothing about the generator emitting that file's frontmatter itself covers any of the three.

Every marked cell is one clause with one control, and § Controls' count is checkable against this table read with its Enforced column. `toml-schema` carries no list of its own: it names this table, takes the rows Enforced marks as its, and adds the one clause that is a path shape rather than a content refusal.

Two surfaces may match the same file. Macroscope stacks both, CodeRabbit may apply both `path_instructions` entries, and Copilot may load both files. No bot resolves a contradiction between them in TOML declaration order, so keeping overlapping surfaces consistent is the author's job.

Write `instructions` as claims about this repo that a competent reviewer would otherwise get wrong: a convention that looks like a bug, a suggestion that has already been made and is wrong, an invariant a test pins. A sentence that would be true of any repo is doctrine, and belongs in a doctrine block.

### `[bot-instructions.doctrine.append]` and `[bot-instructions.doctrine.replace]`

Both tables use doctrine block IDs as keys. `append` adds text to a block; `replace` substitutes the whole block. Unknown block IDs fail validation. Values follow their row in § The content refusals. Line breaks are preserved except in the AGENTS region, whose bullet format follows [the render contract](renders.md).

Prefer `append`. A `replace` means this repo disagrees with doctrine, which is worth arguing at the doctrine source rather than in one repo's TOML. A `replace` on `trust-model` or `render-out-of-scope` also weakens what every bot is told about evidence and scope, so a repo whose gate reads bot output should treat one as the policy change it is.
