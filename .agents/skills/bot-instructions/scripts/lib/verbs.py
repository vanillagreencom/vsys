"""`render`, `check`, `adopt`.

`render` builds and validates a complete scratch tree, then replaces each
path. What this does not claim is an atomic multi-file replacement: no
filesystem offers one, and a mixed tree that says so beats one that does not.
Each individual replacement is atomic, so every path holds either its old
bytes or its new ones.
