"""`.coderabbit.yaml`: full state, driven by the vendored schema.

An unset key resolves down a precedence ladder this package does not control,
so the render writes full state including keys that match their schema
default. **`renders.md` § `.coderabbit.yaml` § Keys states which properties
that is**, and `in_full_state` below is the one predicate that answers it, so
the render and `coderabbit-schema`'s completeness clause cannot make a state
no config satisfies.

Walking the schema rather than transcribing a key list is what makes that true
at every depth: a nested option a vendor adds arrives at its own default and
shows in the diff. `overrides` is where this package has an opinion;
everything else is the vendor's default, written explicitly.
