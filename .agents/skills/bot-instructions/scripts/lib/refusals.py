"""The content refusals, as one table.

`schemas/repo-toml.md` § The content refusals is the spec's statement of this.
Every row here refuses text that would break the STRUCTURE of a file this
package emits; a value this package merely dislikes is not refused.
`toml-schema` applies the rows whose source is `[bot-instructions]`; the
render-side second check applies the `doctrine block text` row, because
doctrine text does not come through that file at all.

**Two of the table's rows are enforced elsewhere, and this is not their copy.**
The glob row is `globs.check`; the `[bot-instructions.cadence] qodo_commands` row is
`config._cadence` reading `constants.QODO_VERBS`. `tests/toml-schema.test.sh`
holds the table against these three, so a row added to either side without the
other reds.

Refusals, not escapes: every class here is refused at input. The render
escapes only what a format requires of text already known to be legal.
