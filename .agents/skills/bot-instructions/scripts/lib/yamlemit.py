"""A YAML emitter for the one file this package writes in YAML.

`renders.md` § `.coderabbit.yaml` fixes the escaping rule: every string is
emitted as a block or folded scalar with explicit indentation, never a quoted
one-line scalar. Repo text is then passed through with no escaping, which
block scalars make safe for everything a YAML scalar can hold — and everything
they cannot hold is refused at input by `repo-toml.md` § The content refusals,
whose `control` predicate covers a YAML scalar and a TOML one at once.

Emitting rather than depending on PyYAML is deliberate: this package is
vendored into repos that need no third-party runtime to render or to check.

    `reviews.path_filters` is the one place a rendered value needs a reason

    at all: an exclusion with no stated reason is indistinguishable from a
    mistake at the next read. A YAML comment runs to end of line, and a
    comment that ends early becomes structure: the rest of the reason is read
    as a mapping key beside `path_filters`.

    No check here. The only text this carries is a `[[bot-instructions.exclusions.path]]
