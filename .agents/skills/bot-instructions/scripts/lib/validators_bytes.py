"""Byte validators: they judge one render — its inputs and the document it
produced — and nothing around it, so they read the scratch tree, on both verbs.

**None of them parses the render back.** A validator whose input is bytes this
run emitted checks the emitter against itself and needs a reader for every
format this package writes. The structure is in hand before it is serialised —
`render.Build.data` — so the same question costs a dictionary lookup.

Each names the silent failure it exists to catch in `schemas/validators.md`.
Every rejection clause here has one red control in `tests/`, asserting on the
validator's own identity rather than on the run's exit code.
