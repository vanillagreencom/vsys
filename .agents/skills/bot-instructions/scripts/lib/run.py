"""One run: what every validator reads, and which ones the verb runs.

`validators.md` § Where these run is the split. Byte validators judge one
render and read the scratch tree on both verbs. Repo-state validators judge
the repository, so a scratch tree is the one place they cannot fail.

`drift` is the one check with no question to answer at render time — a render
exists to change the bytes it compares — and the run says it was skipped
rather than counting it as passed.
