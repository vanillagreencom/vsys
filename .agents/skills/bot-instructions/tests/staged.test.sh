# `drift` under `--staged`: one pair per render input.
#
# `--staged` reads the index for **every** render input, not only the outputs.
# Outputs-only would be wrong in both directions in the pre-commit lane this
# mode exists for: a commit staging a TOML change with its re-rendered outputs
# would red, because the outputs came from the index while the render was
# built from a worktree TOML that may have moved on; and an unstaged doctrine
# edit would silently decide what the staged outputs were compared against,
# passing or failing on bytes nobody is committing.
#
# So each input gets a pair: a staged, consistent set with a divergent
# worktree copy of that input, asserted green, and a staged copy its staged
# outputs are stale against, asserted red. Plus one for absence, asserted on
# the absence rather than on the worktree copy.
#
# The input set is ../SKILL.md § The render inputs, read from that list rather
# than from a copy here. A TOML-only pair is what a generator reading the
# index for the TOML and the worktree for everything else passes, with the
# failure the mode exists to close shipping intact.
