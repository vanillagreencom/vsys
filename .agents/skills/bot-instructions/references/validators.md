# Why validators

Every bot in this set fails silently. An over-limit `.coderabbit.yaml` is discarded whole and the review runs with defaults. A `path_filters` entry missing its `!` turns the list into an allowlist and stops reviewing the rest of the repository. An `excludeAgent` typo loads reviewer doctrine into the working agent. In each case the pull request looks reviewed.

Each validator names the silent failure it catches. Every rejection ships a fixture carrying that defect and asserts the validator's own message. One canonical render also stays green so a validator that rejects everything fails the suite. Vendor web settings are outside every validator's reach and belong in [checklist.md](checklist.md).
