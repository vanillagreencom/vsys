# Vendor limits and read semantics

Every number the generator enforces that comes from a vendor is here with the page that states it. One the generator holds and this file does not carry is a defect: the generator's job is to encode what a vendor documents, not what someone remembers.

A number the package derives from a file format rather than from a vendor is out of scope here and lives with the rule it belongs to. There is one: the heading predicate's three-or-fewer leading spaces, which is markdown's, and which `schemas/repo-toml.md` § The content refusals states once for every reader of it.

**Two kinds of number, and a row says which it is.** A **cap** is a boundary the vendor rejects on: exceed it and the vendor discards or refuses the input, so the generator holds it because the alternative is a silent failure. A **recommendation** is writing guidance the vendor gives with no stated consequence. Where the generator holds a number taken from one, that is a **package budget** and gets its own row saying so, beside the recommendation it came from, so a reader meeting the number in a failure message can find both. Presenting a recommendation as a cap would tell a reader a render was rejected for a reason no vendor states.

Vendor caps move. When a render fails on a limit that looks wrong, re-read the cited page before raising the number in code.

## CodeRabbit

Source of truth is the published schema itself, `https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`, which every repo vendors rather than fetching at check time. Prose reference: <https://docs.coderabbit.ai/reference/configuration>.

| What | Value | Where | Kind |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| `tone_instructions` | 250 characters | schema `maxLength` | cap |
| `reviews.path_instructions[].instructions` | 20,000 characters | schema `maxLength` | cap |
| `reviews.labeling_instructions[].instructions` | 3,000 characters | schema `maxLength` | cap |
| `reviews.finishing_touches.custom[].instructions` | 10,000 characters, 5 entries | schema `maxLength`, `maxItems` | cap |
| `reviews.pre_merge_checks.custom_checks[].instructions` | 10,000 characters, 50 entries | schema `maxLength`, `maxItems` | cap |
| `reviews.profile` | `quiet`, `chill`, `assertive` | schema `enum` | cap |
| Unknown top-level key | rejected | root `additionalProperties: false` | cap |

Only the first two are reachable from this package's renders. The rest are listed because a future render that reaches them inherits a real cap.

**Precedence.** Workspace global overrides, then organization global overrides, then the repo's `.coderabbit.yaml`, then central repository configuration, then repository dashboard, organization dashboard, workspace settings, defaults. An unset key resolves down that ladder per setting rather than falling straight to the schema default, which is why the render writes full state: every layer below the file is unversioned. <https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configuration-overview>

**Read semantics.** The file is read from the pull request's head branch, so a pull request can change its own review configuration.

**`base_branches`.** Setting `reviews.auto_review.base_branches` to `[".*"]` rather than naming the default branch is fleet experience, not documented behavior: naming the branch has been observed to skip pull requests targeting it. The wildcard also covers stacked pull requests.

**Invalid file.** CodeRabbit does not document what it does with a config that fails its schema. Fleet experience is that it discards the file whole and reviews with resolved settings, saying nothing on the pull request. The `coderabbit-schema` validator assumes that, because the assumption costs a validator and the alternative costs an inert config nobody notices.

**`path_filters` and sparse-checkout.** The schema's own description states these patterns also apply to `git sparse-checkout` when cloning. Plain globs only. Extglob and brace patterns pass minimatch and match nothing in sparse-checkout.

## GitHub Copilot code review

<https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/custom-instructions-support> and <https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-on-github/customize-copilot/add-custom-instructions/add-repository-instructions>

| What | Value | Kind |
|------|-------|------|
| Character cap on instruction files | none is documented. Third-party writeups still cite a 4,000-character cut-off on `copilot-instructions.md` and `*.instructions.md`; GitHub removed it | — |
| Size guidance | "Instructions must be no longer than 2 pages" | recommendation |
| `[bot-instructions.budgets] copilot_chars` | 6000 characters, this package's reading of two pages, and the default a repo may raise | package budget |
| `excludeAgent` values | `code-review`, `cloud-agent`. The value names the agent the file is hidden **from**, so `cloud-agent` keeps a file from the working agent and leaves code review reading it, and `code-review` does the reverse. They are not interchangeable | — |
| `applyTo` on an empty or absent value | the file matches nothing and never loads | — |
| `applyTo` | a single string holding comma-separated globs | — |

**What code review reads.** On GitHub.com: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md`, agent instructions (`AGENTS.md`), and organization instructions. Personal instructions are not read by code review. Path-specific instructions are supported by code review on GitHub.com, JetBrains and Xcode, but not in VS Code or Visual Studio, where only the repo-wide file applies.

`cloud-agent` is the current spelling, quoted from the page above: "Use either `"code-review"` or `"cloud-agent"`." Older material spells the same agent `coding-agent`, from before the rename, and material predating both calls it the coding agent in prose. A change to that value belongs to a re-read of the cited page, not to a recollection.

That AGENTS.md row is worth reading twice. Copilot code review does read it, which is what makes `AGENTS.md` the doctrine root — and it is also why **reviewer-only text belongs in a `[[bot-instructions.surface]]` carrying `reviewer_only`**, never in a doctrine block. `excludeAgent` is frontmatter on a `.instructions.md` file, so it cannot protect `AGENTS.md`, and the render puts all eight doctrine blocks there deliberately: they are the review contract this repo's working agents are held to as well, and Codex reads no second surface. What a working agent must not read is repo-specific reviewer guidance, and that is exactly the material `reviewer_only` routes into a file `excludeAgent` can protect.

**Read semantics.** "When reviewing a pull request, Copilot reads repository custom instructions, agent instructions, and agent skills from the head branch (the branch with your changes), not the base branch."

**Precedence.** Personal, then repository, then organization.

**Content exclusion.** Code review honors repository, organization and enterprise content-exclusion settings. Exclusion itself is a settings-UI feature and cannot be expressed in any repo file, which is why it is a checklist item. <https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/configure-content-exclusion/exclude-content-from-copilot>

## Codex code review

<https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/third-party/github>

| What | Value |
|------|-------|
| Instruction file | `AGENTS.md`, and nothing else |
| Read from which branch | not documented |
| Section | `## Code Review Rules` |
| Nesting | root guidance combines with the nearest nested `AGENTS.md` covering each changed file |
| Documented size limit | none |
| File-based exclusion | none exists |

"Add a `## Code Review Rules` section to the file closest to the code the rules govern." One-off steering happens in the trigger comment, not in a file.

## Qodo

Qodo's docs are split by product line, and a row's line decides whether it applies here. Qodo Review is the current product, under `docs.qodo.ai/...`; Qodo Merge is the legacy one, under `docs.qodo.ai/v1/...`. This package's `[review_agent]` keys are Review and its `[pr_reviewer]` keys are Merge, which is why the render writes both.

<https://docs.qodo.ai/install-and-configure/configuration-overview/configuration-file>, <https://docs.qodo.ai/governance/rule-enforcement/without-rule-system/best-practices>

| What | Value | Kind | Line |
|------|-------|------|------|
| `best_practices.md` per file | "Keep files relatively short (under ~800 lines)" | recommendation | Review, and the same words on the Merge page at `/v1/features/best-practices` |
| `[bot-instructions.budgets] qodo_best_practices_lines` | 800 lines, this package's reading of that recommendation, and the default a repo may raise | package budget | — |
| Automatic `best_practices.md` loading | a Qodo Merge (commercial) feature, absent from open-source PR-Agent | — | Merge |

**The 800 is a recommendation, and the budget built on it is this package's.** Qodo gives it as writing guidance — long files are processed less effectively and tend to repeat what the model already knows — and states no rejection or truncation at any length. `qodo-best-practices` still fails over it, for the same reason `copilot-budget` fails over a two-page reading: an unbounded generated file is a render nobody reviews, and a budget someone can see beats a length nobody chose. What it must not claim is that Qodo refused the file.

Both numbers that would have been caps are gone. An accumulated limit across every source Qodo loads, and an open-source PR-Agent `repo_context_max_lines` default, appeared in material that now 404s and are on no page that replaced it. Neither is enforced here, because a number this file cannot cite is a number the generator does not hold.

**Configuration locations.** Repo root `.pr_agent.toml`, documented as the root of the default branch, a repo wiki page of the same name, a `pr-agent-settings` repository at project or organization level, and the Qodo portal.

**Precedence.** The docs state that project-level settings take precedence over organization-level, and that "a repository's local configuration always overrides both". They do not rank the repo root against the repo wiki. The package ships the root file and treats the wiki as a channel to keep empty, which is correct under either ranking; the checklist carries the step that confirms no wiki page exists.

**Sections that matter.** `/review` reads `[pr_reviewer] extra_instructions`. `/agentic_review` reads `[review_agent]`, which carries one key per agent: `issues_user_guidelines` for bug, security and performance detection, `compliance_user_guidelines` for rule checking, and `smart_router_extra_instructions` for the agent deciding review depth. <https://docs.qodo.ai/code-review/extra-instructions>

**Exclusions.** `[ignore]` globs plus pull-request-level keys (`ignore_pr_labels`, `ignore_pr_authors`, `ignore_pr_title`, branch filters) and `allow_only_specific_folders`. There is no per-path instruction mechanism.

**`REVIEW.md`.** A root file of plain-markdown review guidelines all Qodo review agents follow, enabled once in the portal under Configurations → Context. Qodo product functionality, not an open-source PR-Agent guarantee. <https://docs.qodo.ai/governance/use-review-md>

## Macroscope

<https://docs.macroscope.com/custom-instructions>, <https://docs.macroscope.com/check-run-agents>, <https://docs.macroscope.com/bug-detection-and-fixes#macroscope-ignore>

| What | Value |
|------|-------|
| Instruction files | `.macroscope/correctness/**/*.md`, `*.md` only, `README.md` ignored |
| Reserved names at `.macroscope/` root | `ignore.md`, `approvability.md` |
| Governing file | `.macroscope/correctness/correctness.md`, "at the top level of the directory, spelled exactly that way" |
| Governing-file frontmatter | `waitsFor`, `requires`, `waitsForTimeout` (default 20 minutes), `waitsForDiscoveryTimeout` (default 1 minute), configuring the whole correctness check |
| Frontmatter on a correctness file | `include`, `exclude`, both optional glob arrays |
| Evaluation order | `exclude` after `include`; omitted frontmatter applies repo-wide |
| Check-run agent `title` | 60 characters |
| Check-run agent enums | `reasoning`: `off`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`. `effort`: `low`, `medium`, `high`. `input`: `full_diff`, `code_object`, `pr_metadata`. `conclusion`: `neutral`, `failure` |

Subdirectories are organizational only. Multiple instruction files matching one changed file stack. The governing file is the exception to "a correctness file is just instructions": its four fields set the check run's prerequisites and timeouts, and no other file can carry them.

**`ignore.md` grammar.** Simplified glob syntax, one pattern per line. Lines starting with `#` are comments and blank lines are ignored. `**` matches across directories, `*` within one path segment, `?` one character, and a pattern with no `/` matches at any depth. Maximum 1,000 patterns. Matching is deterministic with no override mechanism.

**`ignore.md` scope.** Repository-wide exclusion, applying to every check run. An agent's own `include` patterns override it, which is a reason not to give an agent a broad `include`.

**Read semantics.** Configuration is read from the most recent commit on the pull request, so an edit takes effect on that pull request immediately. A pull request from an external fork always reads configuration from the default branch.

**Settings-only.** Whether correctness review runs, detection mode, minimum severity to comment, maximum automatic runs, and spend caps are dashboard settings with no repo-file equivalent.
