# Tests for open-terminal's per-item worktree-create handling.
#
# The worktree create is the ownership claim for a fleet launch: exit 75 means
# another session holds the item. Under `set -euo pipefail` an unguarded
# `wt="$(worktree create ...)"` aborted the WHOLE batch on the first owned
# item, so its siblings never launched. An owned item must be skipped (named on
# stderr, counted in the summary) and the remaining items still launch; any
# other create failure is that item's failure alone, not an abort.
#
# `--relaunch` covers the replacement launch: the dead lane already created the
# item's worktree, so a bare create reads it as a claim and skips the item. The
# flag reuses that tree; a lease held under another owner still skips, and a
# tree that was cleaned up takes the bare form.
#
# The test runs a byte-identical copy of open-terminal inside a temp git repo
# so `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` resolves to a hermetic PROJECT_ROOT, and
# stubs the worktree CLI (scripted per-item exit codes, call log), the GUI
# terminal, and gh so nothing external is launched.
