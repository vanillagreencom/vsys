# Tests for queue-wait's `conflicting` verdict, split
# from queue_wait.sh at the seam its fixture stub draws (the poll/verdict
# suites and their sequenced stub live there).
#
# The failure this closes: a PR whose head conflicts with its base is armed
# and stays armed. Nothing ejects it, nothing disarms it, and the watch
# reported it "still queued, still progressing" until the deadline — the arm
# flag read as the merge verdict. GitHub's own `mergeable` says CONFLICTING
# from the first poll, and the fix is a restack, not another CI cycle.
#
# Covered:
#   1. CONFLICTING routes the conflicting verdict, cause base_conflict
#   2. it is confirmed across polls like every other terminal verdict
#   3. it outranks ejected, whose recovery would be a CI cycle, and the
#      failed-check probe, which routes to the same CI cycle on one look
#   4. MERGEABLE and UNKNOWN route nothing
#   5. state is read first: a merged PR never reports conflicting
#   6. the human-readable line names the verdict and the remedy
