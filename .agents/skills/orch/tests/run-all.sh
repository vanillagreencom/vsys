#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Run every orch test in tests/*.sh.
#
# Each individual *.sh test is self-contained: builds its own sandbox,
# exercises the target script, prints `pass: N   fail: M`, exits 0 iff
# all assertions passed. This runner invokes them in parallel and
# aggregates the overall exit code so CI / pre-commit hooks have a
# single entry point.
#
# Usage:
#   bash skills/orch/tests/run-all.sh
#   bash skills/orch/tests/run-all.sh session_init      # subset by name
#   bash skills/orch/tests/run-all.sh open-terminal oversee   # either name
#   bash skills/orch/tests/run-all.sh '!open-terminal' '!oversee'  # neither
#   bash skills/orch/tests/run-all.sh =lanes      # that one suite alone
#
# Each argument is a substring of a suite's base name, or, written `=name`,
# the whole of one. A bare one selects, one written `!name` rejects, and a
# file runs when it matches a selector — or none was given — and matches no
# rejector. Two runs whose arguments are
# a set and that set negated therefore partition the battery: every suite
# runs in exactly one of them, and a suite added later lands in the negated
# run rather than in neither. CI's orch shards are that partition.
#
# Suites run as many at a time as `nproc` reports, or 4 where it cannot
# answer (a stock macOS has no nproc). A suite's stdout and stderr are held
# until it exits and then printed whole under its header, so two suites
# never interleave; headers come in the order the runner reaps the
# suites, which follows completion to within one 0.1s poll. A suite in ALONE
# below runs by itself after the others. run-all.sh prints a start line as
# it launches each suite, so a run cut off by a signal or a job timeout still
# names every suite that was running; after each suite's output it prints
# one line, and after the last suite one total line:
#
#   start suite=<name>
#   suite=<name> seconds=<n> pass=<n> fail=<n>
#   total suites=<n> seconds=<n> pass=<n> fail=<n>
#
# The `orch tests:` verdict line follows the total, and on a red run one
# `  - <name>` line per red suite follows the verdict.
#
# `seconds` is the suite's own wall time, and the total's is the whole run's.
# `pass` and `fail` are the counts from the last summary line the suite
# printed in any of the shapes the suites use (`pass: N  fail: M`,
# `N passed, M failed`, `N pass, M fail`, or Python unittest's `Ran N tests`
# with `OK` or `FAILED (failures=N, errors=M)`), and 0 where it printed none.
# A suite that exits non-zero with no failure counted reports fail=1, so a
# red suite never prints fail=0.
