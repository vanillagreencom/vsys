# open-terminal's fleet caps: a fresh launch under --state-dir is refused as
# cap-reached where the fleet's running and preparing records plus its
# unrecorded live claims reach ORCH_OVERSEER_LANES, and as account-cap-reached
# where the fleet's records on its lane plus the live claims there no such
# record accounts for reach ORCH_LANE_ACCOUNT_CLAIMS, both judged
# under the fleet's lock and the claim store's, held from the count through the
# reservation write, which refuses the launch where it fails. A relaunch meets the fleet cap where the item has no running or preparing
# record, and the account cap where it has none or moves to another account.
# --over-cap admits one launch and records the caps it passed, and --wait-slot
# waits for room instead of refusing.
