# The neutral world the two lane suites (lanes.sh, open-terminal-lane.sh)
# share: fake account config dirs, a usage-API fetch stub that answers from
# fixture files, and the canned usage bodies. It also carries `settled_mutex`,
# the one reading of a reaped lock every suite that bounds a renewal shares.
# Nothing here plants a defect; a case that needs one writes it into its own
# home.
#
# Sourced, never run: the runners glob tests/*.sh, so the `lib/` prefix keeps
# this file out of the run. The sourcing suite sets TMP_ROOT first, which only
# `new_home` reads, so a suite that wants `settled_mutex` alone needs none.
