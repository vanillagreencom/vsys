# Virtual clock for the waiter suites: PATH stubs for `date` and `sleep` that
# put a poll budget under the suite's control instead of the machine's.
#
# The waiters read wall time only as `date +%s` and wait only through `sleep`,
# so owning those two commands makes every budget exact. A sleep advances the
# clock and returns; a poll costs nothing unless a stub is told to charge for it
# by sleeping itself. What the cases then assert is arithmetic over the clock
# the waiter keeps, and it lands on the same number however slow the machine is.
#
# Two things follow. Deadline cases stop racing the runner: on wall time a suite
# running a few-second budget has no margin worth the name, and once a poll
# costs a large fraction of a second the deadline arrives before the poll that
# was meant to land inside it — a contended CI runner and a busy developer box
# both produce that. And no poll budget is spent in real time, so these suites
# cost the shard no minutes of waiting.
#
# The clock is seeded once, at install, and runs forward for the whole suite.
# Every waiter takes its own start time at process start and derives its budget
# from that, so no case reads an absolute time and nothing needs a reset
# between runs.
#
# Sourced, never run: the runners glob tests/*.sh, so the `lib/` prefix keeps
# this file out of the run. Sourcing defines the functions and nothing else; a
# suite calls `virtual_clock_install` once its stub bin directory exists.
#
# Escape hatch: a case that needs a REAL sleep — one proving a bounded wait
# around a hang, say — runs with `STUB_CLOCK=` in its environment. Both stubs
# fall through to the real command when STUB_CLOCK is unset or empty, so the
# exemption is per-case and needs no second PATH. A STUB_CLOCK that is set but
# names no file is the other thing entirely — a clock that broke rather than one
# waived — and both stubs refuse it rather than degrade to wall time.

# Install the stubs into <bin_dir> and start the clock in <clock_file>.
# Exports STUB_CLOCK, STUB_REAL_DATE and STUB_REAL_SLEEP, so any subshell the
# suite runs the waiter in inherits them without threading them through. Called
# for effect during setup: every failure below exits the suite rather than
# returning, so no caller can continue with the budgets back on wall time.
