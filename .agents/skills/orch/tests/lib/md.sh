# The one markdown reader the doc lints share. It lives under orch because
# orch's lints are its callers; a suite in any skill may source it by path.
#
# An editorial rephrase must not redden a suite while the contract holds. What
# a doc lint may pin is an IDENTIFIER — a heading, a state field, an inline
# code literal, a setting name — and the placement of one identifier relative
# to another.
#
# The rule forms are deliberately few, and these are all of them:
#
#   rule NAME FILE HEADING TOKEN...   one line under HEADING holds every TOKEN
#   rule_fenced NAME FILE HEADING T…  the same, but the line must be a command
#                                     inside a ```bash/```sh fence
#   forbid NAME RE SAMPLE FILE...     no line in any FILE matches RE
#   forbid_fenced NAME RE SAMPLE F... no ```bash/```sh command line matches RE
#   permits_fenced NAME RE PROBE SAMPLE FILE
#                                     SAMPLE is not flagged where PROBE is
#
# One rule is one token set on one line. A rule that needs a second token set
# is a second rule, and a contract too subtle for that is uncovered here rather
# than covered in appearance.
#
# NO TRANSCRIBED VALUES, in this file or in any suite's header. That covers two
# kinds, and the second is the one a sweep for counts misses: a count OF the
# tree — suites, rules, files, lines — and a value copied OUT of another file,
# a CI timeout or a setting's default. Both go stale silently, because nothing
# rechecks a comment. Give the command that derives it and the scope it runs
# over, or pin the other file's line with a `rule` so the two fail together.
# Inherent counts stay: "the two state buckets" names the contract itself, and
# no change to the tree can make it wrong.
#
# A suite also gets, beyond the rule forms: `pass` and `fail` for a verdict it
# reaches itself, `md_report` to close, the path variables SKILL_DIR,
# SKILLS_ROOT, REPO_ROOT and MD_LIB_DIR, and MD_TMP for scratch. Nothing else
# here is a suite's to call.
#
# THOSE PATHS ARE RESOLVED FROM THIS FILE, so TESTS_DIR, SKILL_DIR and
# SKILLS_ROOT all name orch whoever sourced it. A caller outside orch must set
# its own SKILL_DIR after the `source` line, or a rule written in the house
# style, `"$SKILL_DIR/SKILL.md"`, reads orch's document and answers about the
# wrong file. REPO_ROOT and MD_LIB_DIR are the same for every caller.
#
# A suite must NOT install its own EXIT trap. Sourcing this file installs one
# that removes MD_TMP, and `trap ... EXIT` replaces rather than adds, so a
# suite setting its own leaks a mktemp directory per run — no symptom but
# growth under TMPDIR. The idiom is common in this directory, which makes it
# the shape a lint written here would copy from its neighbours; see with
# `grep -l 'trap .* EXIT' skills/orch/tests/*.sh`. Put scratch under MD_TMP and
# let this trap clean it up.
#
# READING RULES. Every read goes through `_md_scan`, one pass that classifies
# each line as outside a fence, inside one, or a fence delimiter, and blanks
# HTML-comment spans ONLY outside a fence. Three consequences the lints depend
# on. A heading-shaped line inside a fence is not a heading, so the summary
# templates the orch workflows embed (`## Recommendations Processed` at column
# zero, `# Linear` as a shell comment) do not truncate the section around
# them. A `<!--` inside a fence is literal text, so `printf '<!--'` cannot
# blank every line after it. And a rule commented out inside its own section,
# or by a `<!--` opened above the heading, reads as absent.
#
# A heading argument matches a heading line EXACTLY, after trimming, and a
# heading two lines answer to is reported rather than resolved by document
# position: `## 4. Present And Fix` must not select `## 4. Present And Fix
# Notes` sitting above it.
#
# CONTROL REGIME. `md_report` closes every suite and proves each registered
# rule can go red. What it proves differs by form, and only `rule` and
# `rule_fenced` get the cross-rule check:
#
#   rule, rule_fenced  every occurrence of the rule's first token is deleted
#                      from the line the rule matched, then every rule that
#                      HELD before the mutation is re-evaluated against it.
#                      Exactly the mutated rule must go red. One that reddens
#                      a second rule is redundant with it; one that reddens
#                      nothing has no teeth. Both fail. A rule already red on
#                      the unmutated tree is left out: it reported its own
#                      failure, and counting it here would blame this control.
#   forbid, forbid_fenced
#                      the SAMPLE is appended to a scratch copy of EVERY
#                      registered file in turn, and each must be flagged.
#   permits_fenced     no registry and no control loop: it carries its own
#                      positive half, the PROBE, in line.
#
# Both forms that can pass on an empty search result — `forbid` and
# `permits_fenced` — carry a positive control, so neither can report a proof it
# did not perform. That is the whole of it: every other `pass` here follows a
# match that was found, or a mutation that was verified to have planted
# something.
#
# The rule control re-evaluates every held rule once per rule, so a suite's
# control pass costs O(N^2) file reads in its rule count. Measure the law
# rather than trusting a number here, which is one machine's on one day:
#
#   for n in 10 20 30 40; do   # N rules, each matching its own fixture line
#     ... build the fixture and the suite, then: time bash the-suite
#   done
#   time (for f in skills/orch/tests/*lint*.test.sh; do bash "$f"; done)
#   grep -cE '^(rule|rule_fenced) ' skills/orch/tests/*lint*.test.sh
#
# Doubling the rules costs roughly four times the time, while every orch lint
# suite together finishes in a few seconds,
# well inside the orch shard's timeout — `timeout-minutes` on the
# skill-suites-shard job in `.github/workflows/skill-tests.yml`, which is where
# to read it rather than here. What the law means for an author is that a suite
# growing past roughly thirty rules is paying a superlinear price and is better
# split by contract.
#
# One optimization is applied, above: the held-set pre-check is loop-invariant,
# so computing it once takes the control pass from 2N^2 reads to N^2 + N. The
# commands above are what measure what that is worth on a given machine.
# Per-path memoization of the reader, a pre-stripped control scratch, and a
# file-grouped loop each measure at 20 percent or worse against the orch
# shard's budget, which does not pay for the redesign they point at.
