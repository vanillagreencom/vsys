# mutant_scripts NAME [FILE] — a must-fail control mutates a private copy of
# one script, never the shipped one. Every orch script finds its siblings and
# lib/ through its own directory without resolving a symlink, so a lone `cp`
# of dev-round-write dies on startup, and a control whose mutant never runs
# credits a pass to nothing. This builds $TMP_ROOT/NAME/scripts as real
# directories of symlinks to the shipped scripts, with FILE, a path relative
# to scripts/, the one private copy, which the caller mutates with
# mutate_file. With no FILE every entry is a link: the live scripts, placed
# where a stand-in such as the Linear CLI can sit beside their skill. The
# shipped scripts are the ones beside this tests/ directory, so a suite run
# from an installed layout mutates its own. Prints the scripts directory;
# callers need TMP_ROOT. Callers take the path through a command
# substitution, where errexit does not reach, so every setup step refuses on
# its own before the path is printed: a tree missing a sibling would kill the
# mutant for that reason and credit the control to it rather than to the
# planted defect.

# mutate_file FILE OLD NEW — the substitution half of a must-fail control,

# running the unmutated script, and a control that cannot fail proves only that
# its row ran. FILE is a private copy, mutant_scripts' FILE or the caller's
# own; a symlink is refused, since editing through it would rewrite the
# shipped script and editing around it would leave the mutant unmutated. Its
# assert_eq is lib/assertions.sh's, which the caller sources.
