# lib/branch-growth.sh from their own directory, so a lone `cp` of one of them
# produces a mutant that dies on startup — and a control whose mutant never
# runs credits a pass to nothing. Copy the whole scripts/ tree instead and take
# the mutant from inside it. Prints the copied scripts directory; callers need

# its row ran. The caller copies the script first, by copy_scripts above or its
