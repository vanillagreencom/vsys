# Tests for worktree-push: the push wrapper that reconciles
# rebased commit SHAs in workflow state. A `rebase-map:` line from the
# worktree skill's push must land in `.rebase_map` and rewrite every recorded
# fix commit in the same call — including when the network push itself fails,
# because the rebase (and its map) happens before the push. A map the wrapper
# cannot record is reported, with the replayed transcript as its only
# surviving copy; nothing may leave stale SHAs silently. A completed restack
# leaves its own map in the worktree instead of on a stream, so that file is
# consumed and deleted before the push, and its hop is applied before the
# push's own so a record moved twice ends on the final SHA.
