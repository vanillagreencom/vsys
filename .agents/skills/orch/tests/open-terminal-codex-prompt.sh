# The composed line crosses another quoting layer (e.g. an agent-confine
# wrapper) before the spawned window's shell runs it; once the single quotes
# are consumed, fish expands a bare `$orch` to empty and errors, so codex
# launches with NO prompt argv and the fleet worker sits at an empty composer.
# Codex also has no /orch slash command, so the arms must deliver a plain-prose
# kickoff naming .agents/skills/orch/SKILL.md, built only from shell-inert
# characters — no `$`, backtick, or anything else a downstream shell layer
# could expand after one round of quote consumption.
#
# The test runs a byte-identical copy of open-terminal inside a temp git repo so
# `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` resolves to a hermetic PROJECT_ROOT, stubs the
# worktree CLI and gh, and stubs ghostty to capture the composed command it
# would launch.
