# The last layer before a window opens: a launch whose working directory does
# not exist is refused by name.
#
# A suite that drives `open-terminal` with a stubbed worktree CLI gets an empty
# path back the moment the stub exits 0 without printing one — the shape a
# PATH stub leaves when its fixture tree is deleted under it — and open_gui
# handing that empty path to a real GUI terminal opens a window on the
# operator's desktop at a directory that is gone. The same is true of any
# lane whose worktree was removed while it ran. Refusing here closes it
# whatever produced the launch, without asking who did.
#
# Everything external is stubbed: the GUI terminal and tmux (invocations
# logged, so a refusal that still launched is visible), gh, and the worktree
# CLI.
