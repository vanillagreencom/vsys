# `workflow-state set <id> rereview_panel <json>` — the write review-pr § 4
# makes when it re-enters § 2 — is itself the re-review cycle: it raises
# `rereview_cycles` under the same lock it is gated on, and refuses once that
# count reaches REVIEW_MAX_CYCLES (default 4). The count is entries already
# taken, so the setting is the number of entries allowed and the stored count
# never exceeds it: at a cap of 4 the fifth write is refused at exactly 4.
#
# `cycles` decides nothing here. It is the general fix-round tally
# `dev-fix.md` keeps, bumped by QA fix rounds and by review/submit fix rounds
# that run before the loop starts; those must leave the loop budget untouched.
# The failing direction runs first so a green pass is evidence.
