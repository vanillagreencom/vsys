# What a rejected review item is TOLD, asserted against the real
# review-artifact-check. Split from review_artifact_check.sh, which asks
# whether an artifact is accepted; these cases ask what the rejection says
# back, because that text is relayed verbatim to the agent that must redo the
# work.
#
# four artifacts were rejected in one session by agents that
# followed the workflow text without opening the schema. Two reached for
# `priority: 5`; two used plausible-but-wrong field names (`detail`,
# `remediation`, `file`+`line`). Every case here drives the shipped script and
# reads the `detail` it returns.
