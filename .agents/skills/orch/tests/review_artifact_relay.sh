# Do the ORCHESTRATOR workflows relay what review-artifact-check reports?
# Split from review_artifact_check_item_schema.sh, which asks what the script
# itself does; every assertion here is about a call site.
#
# Only fail-OPEN contracts live here. A workflow that stops relaying one of
# these accepts a review it should not, and every behavioural suite stays
# green, so nothing else would notice:
#
#   valid_undermeasured + measurement_failed + measurement_suppressed
#       An ok=TRUE reason. A site that routes on ok alone records a review
#       whose own instrument produced nothing as an ordinary pass.
#   the --file freshness boundary
#       `review-artifact-check --file ART` with no boundary argument answers
#       valid for an artifact of any age; the boundary in the workflow prose
#       is the whole of staleness detection, so a site that drops it accepts
#       a previous round's artifact as this round's.
#   the two acceptance forms review-pr.md replaced
#       Return-message-only completion, and an inline `jq -e '.verdict'`
#       branch, are both weaker than the check they gave way to.
#
# Contracts whose loss costs a wasted round rather than a bad accept are NOT
# pinned here: the reviewer-side schema route and self-check are covered by
# skills/reviewer/tests/measurement-fail-closed.test.sh, and submit-pr's
# wait-protocol and launch-failure branches fail closed on their own.
#
# EACH CONTRACT IS PINNED IN TWO HALVES, and neither is sound alone. The
# off-branch half asserts that no mention sits outside an `ok == true` branch;
# on a file with no mentions at all it evaluates to zero and passes. The count
# half is what makes it mean something. Drop one and the pair goes vacuous.
