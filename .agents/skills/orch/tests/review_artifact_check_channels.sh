# The check's OWN MACHINERY, as opposed to the measurement gates it runs: the
# three channels a gate answers on (exit status, stdout, stderr), what happens
# when jq or mktemp cannot run at all, and the rule that no mode exits without
# a parseable result. Split from review_artifact_check_measurement.sh, which
# holds whatever the gates measure.
#
# One table: each row stages one artifact body in a fresh worktree, runs the
# check under one jq (real, or a shim that breaks one thing) in one mode
# (--file, glob, --wait), and asserts once. A row's `expect` names the result
# fields it pins and `observe` reads exactly those; a missing key reads ABSENT.
# The second table drives the last-resort emitter directly with the strings
# JSON cannot carry raw.
