# workflow-state's writes on a host with no flock(1).
#
# Every mutating subcommand runs its read-decide-write under a lock, because
# two `set` calls racing on one state file both read, both write, and the
# later write drops the earlier transition. flock is util-linux and stock
# macOS ships none, where the bare `flock -w 10 200` this used to run resolved
# to nothing, the `||` arm fired, and every write refused with "could not
# acquire lock" — so on that platform workflow-state did not work at all.
# scripts/lib/file-lock.sh carries the lock with a mkdir mutex there.
#
# The probe PATH is the real one minus flock rather than a list of the tools
# workflow-state uses, so it stays true as the script changes.
