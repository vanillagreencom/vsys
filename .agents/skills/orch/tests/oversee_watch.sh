# Tests for the GitHub side of orch/scripts/oversee-watch, and for
# the failures that take the whole process down. The pane side is in the three
# lane suites: window-gone, lane-exited, lane-asking and idle-after-return in
# oversee_watch_lanes.sh, prompt state across runs in
# oversee_watch_lane_asking.sh, and usage-limit with usage-limit-passed in
# oversee_watch_usage_limit.sh. Tracker events are in oversee_watch_triage.sh. All use the
# shared lib/oversee-watch-harness.sh sandbox.
#
# oversee-watch is the overseer's single blocking watch: it loops until the
# fleet needs a hand and prints one wake carrying every event the pass found,
# one EVENT line each, and exits once. Covered here:
#   1.  pr-watch: on the fleet's first run attention present at start is a
#       baseline (no event, one stderr note, context on the next event); that
#       baseline persists, so a line appearing between two runs is the next
#       run's first-pass event and a standing line is not; an unseen `<pr> <kind>`
#       line mid-run is the event; a head-only change is not; GH_REPO reaches
#       pr-watch and its argv is exactly --heal, for every repo; a
#       heal-dispatched line is never a key — alone, re-attributed to another
#       PR, or alone on a repo that is not the first reduced — while the
#       gate-stale beside it still fires and is the only key baselined; an
#       error key preempts a repo's opening pass while every other kind there
#       still baselines silently;
#       rc≠0 with no lines is a global failure (exit 2); attention
#       at start does not starve a lane's question, and a new line and a
#       question on one pass are both reported, the control being the
#       reducer's early exit restored; the state file is
#       rewritten after every pass, and an uncreatable state dir or an
#       unreadable state file exits 2 naming the path; the reducer runs for
#       every --repo, with per-repo baselines and repo-prefixed lines on both
#       streams, no baseline advances until the whole pass has reduced, a repo
#       named for the first time baselines its standing attention in either
#       ordering, the context header carries the highest status across repos, a
#       global failure names its repo, a repeated --repo exits 2 naming the
#       spelling given, and --repo=VALUE is the same option
#   2.  merged: an --item's PR merged at/after --since fires, naming its
#       repo; a PR merged BEFORE --since, a non-item branch, and a non-item
#       conventional branch do not; a fork's PR on the same head branch name
#       does not; item ids match branches case-insensitively; no --since
#       means no floor; no --item skips the check with a note; gh stderr
#       noise on success does not break the JSON parse; a PR merged in a
#       non-first --repo fires, the fork rejection holding per repo, red with
#       the lookup narrowed to the first repo; a merged item still in --item
#       is reported once across runs while a further PR on its branch is
#       news, red with the row never kept
#   2b. handoff: an --item whose state carries `.handoff` with no
#       `.resumed_at` fires once, with the record, read from the item's
#       worktree state (this checkout's when it has no worktree); a state
#       without the key and a resumed record fire nothing; a re-run before
#       the relaunch stamps the record fires nothing; the must-fail control
#       is the emit arm removed
#   3.  heartbeat after --max-loops with every --repo's open PR list, each
#       line prefixed with its repo, red with the list narrowed to the first
#   4.  gh auth failure exits 2; a stale env token falls through to the
#       project GH_BOT_TOKEN; a failing pr list exits 2 (never a quiet 0)
#   5.  lanes given outside tmux exit 2
#   6.  a missing pr-watch.sh is a stderr note, not a failure; inside tmux an
#       --item with no lane window is a stderr note naming the pane checks
#       skipped, once, and outside tmux or without --item there is none
#   7.  --help exits 0, names the probe it runs, and states both liveness
#       rules including the unusable-probe path
