# path fell through the `|| true` swallow to the main fallback with exit 0,
# handing callers an unverified base. The resolver must fail closed (exit 1,
# actionable error) on a missing path or a non-repository directory — on BOTH
# arms, since WORKTREE_DEFAULT_BRANCH skips the git resolution entirely — and
# keep resolving valid worktrees exactly as before.
