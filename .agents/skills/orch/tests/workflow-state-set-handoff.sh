# `workflow-state set <id> handoff <record>`: the record's time is the
# script's, not the lane's. A lane types its handoff at a safe point, and a
# typed time can name a moment that has not arrived, which makes a relaunch
# look faster than it was. The command stamps an absent `written_at`, keeps a
# past one, refuses a future one, refuses one outside the ISO 8601 UTC shape
# the schema names or naming no instant a calendar has, refuses a record that
# is not a JSON object, and refuses the set outright when its own clock
# cannot be read. The `fleet_log` half of the same rule is
# workflow-state-append-file.sh; both call one `stamp_judge`.
