#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The orch suites build git fixtures, and git's environment variables outrank
# `git -C <path>`. A suite that inherits GIT_DIR, GIT_COMMON_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE
# or GIT_INDEX_FILE from its caller commits into the caller's repository and
# leaves its index carrying deletions of paths that never existed there, while
# still reporting a clean pass. lib/git-env.sh clears all four at load and
# every suite sources it.
#
# Two surfaces, each with the mutation that must break it:
#   1. the clearing works — a real suite run with all four exported at a
#      sandbox repository leaves that repository's log and index untouched;
#      neutralize lib/git-env.sh beside links to the rest and the same run
#      writes to it
#   2. the lint holds — every suite under tests/ carries the source line
#      directly under its `set -...o pipefail`. Presence alone is not the rule:
#      the line at the end of the file, inside a dead branch, or inside a
#      heredoc body that writes a stub all leave the fixture work unprotected,
#      so the lint pins the position and the probe carries one of each.
