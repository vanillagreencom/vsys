# `workflow-state init` overwrites. A workflow that runs it over a restored
# state file drops the item's round history: `cycles`, `fixed_items` and
# `patched_causes`. Every workflow that runs `init` therefore reads
# `workflow-state exists --json` first.
#
# A fenced rule pins the `exists` command in the section holding the `init`;
# dev-start runs `init` in its preamble, which has no heading of its own, so
# its rule reads the whole file. A prose rule reads the whole file too, and
# pins the guard and the `init` on one line. The two workflows that keep an
# existing state also pin both `workflow-state set` commands of that path. A
# minted rule covers a workflow that inits only a key `workflow-state
# new-local-key` printed in the same section, which no restored state can hold,
# and pins that mint command there. The file-set check fails when a workflow
# gains an `init` no rule here reads.
