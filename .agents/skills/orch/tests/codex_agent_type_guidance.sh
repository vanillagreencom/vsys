# Contract tests for Codex spawn identity and the delegation-timestamp ordering.
#
# Codex must spawn the generated kendex agent as the runtime agent type rather
# than launching a generic worker and simulating identity in prompt text. The
# translation mechanics are BEHAVIOURALLY tested in spawn_adapter.sh; what is
# pinned here is that the docs still route to the adapter, still state the
# identity rule, still record the runtime spelling as metadata, and still stamp
# the review freshness boundary in the one position that makes it meaningful.
