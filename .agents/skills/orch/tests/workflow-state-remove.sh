# `workflow-state remove ITEM`: an item's close-out. Every entry of the state
# directory named for the item goes whatever its age, its workflow state and
# lock among them, and nothing named for another item. The lane status file
# and the lane mailbox stay for the prune's retention, and so do the fleet's
# own files. One archive takes what goes, those two and each --archive path
# first, and a failed archive removes nothing. Where no fleet state stands,
# the close-out runs the prune too.
