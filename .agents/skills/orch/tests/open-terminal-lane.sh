# the defaults; an item `cwd=DIR` runs from DIR instead of the checkout,
# `max_pct=unset` drops the pinned launch threshold so `lanes` decides, and
# `prep=store_ro` or `prep=claims_file` stages this run's claim store as a
# read-only directory or as a plain file before the launch, `flags=S` passes S
# as one --launch-flags string and `cmd=S` passes S as one --cmd template. Those
# last two exist because a lane launch names both a model and an effort, which
# is two words, while a table row's args field is word-split; the env list is
# not. They are alternatives, never both: --launch-flags beside --cmd reach
# nothing and open-terminal refuses them, so a row whose launch runs its own
# command spells the pair inside that command. OUT is stdout and stderr

echo "=== with no threshold flag the launcher forwards none and lanes decides ==="
# The bound lives in `lanes` alone. A launch passing no --lane-max-pct is judged
# on exactly the number the oversee directive's own `lanes pick` used; a second
# default here is what handed the overseer an account this gate then refused,
# so the item never launched and the same lane was picked again next cycle.
#
# The rows run against a copy of the scripts placed outside every checkout, and
# that is what isolates them: open-terminal takes its project root from `git -C`
# on its OWN directory, not from the working directory, so the shipped script
# loads this repository's kendex.settings.toml and exports its threshold to the
# `lanes` it spawns. The copy loads no settings file, run_ot's pin is dropped,
# and the suite unsets the variable, so the number that decides is the one
# `lanes` holds. The whole scripts directory is copied because open-terminal
# resolves its libraries and `lanes` beside itself, and the github libs are laid
# beside the copy because an orch lib reaches them by a fixed relative path.
