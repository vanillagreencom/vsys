# Under Codex `approval=never` an env-assignment prefix (`VAR=value cmd args`,
# e.g. `LC_ALL=C tools/test-ci-changes`) is rejected purely for its prefix
# shape — the inner command is irrelevant. The canonical normalization
# (../references/codex-runtime.md § Env-assignment prefixes) happens where a
# required command is ACCEPTED into a workflow: confirm the ambient
# environment satisfies the precondition, then run the bare command. So no
# fenced ```bash/```sh command line in the orch or dev docs may open with one.
#
# A plain assignment with no command after it is a value, not a prefix, and it
# stays legal whether its value is bare, quoted, or spaced. What the shell
# treats as a prefix is flagged whatever the value looks like: `LC_ALL= cmd`,
# `LC_ALL="C" cmd` and `LC_ALL=C"UTF-8" cmd` are each one.

# NAME=, then a value that may be empty, unquoted, quoted, or a mix of those,
