# Every block a lane fills itself cites that rule, because a workflow section
# reached without the reference is a lane printing into a pane with no reader.
#
# A block nested inside a `<delegation_format>` is the opposite case and must
# NOT carry the citation. It is the delegated agent's return shape, which the
# lane reads, so quiet never covers it; and the citation's relative link is
# written from the workflow file, which the pasted delegation is not.
