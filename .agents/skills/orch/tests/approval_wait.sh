# Parametrized `gh` stub (same auth model as the ci_wait stub), a neutral fake
# GitHub: every payload is selected per run by the STUB_* variables below, so
# no case inherits another's world.
#   STUB_APPROVAL_MODE selects the canned `pr view --json
#   reviewDecision,latestReviews` payload; STUB_THREADS_UNRESOLVED sets the
#   unresolved count returned by the `api graphql` reviewThreads query.
#   STUB_APPROVAL_COUNT_FILE turns *_later modes into poll-count-driven
#   sequences (first poll pending, second poll terminal).
#   Review mode: `pr view --json headRefOid,author` reports head "headsha1"
#   and author "pr-author" (STUB_HEAD_MODE=changes flips to "headsha2" after
#   two calls via STUB_HEAD_COUNT_FILE); STUB_REVIEWS_MODE selects the canned
#   REST pulls/reviews payload, with STUB_REVIEWS_COUNT_FILE driving the
#   reviewed_later poll sequence.
#   Check-runs: `api repos/*/commits/<sha>/check-runs` answers per the sha in
#   the URL — STUB_CHECKS_MODE=success_at_head/failure_at_head publishes a
#   "Review Bot" run (older failure + newer terminal run, plus an unrelated
#   "Other Check") on headsha1 only; success_stale publishes it on oldsha
#   only, so the current-head query finds nothing.
#   Automatic-review target set: `api repos/owner/repo` answers the default
#   branch (STUB_DEFAULT_BRANCH, or a 500 under STUB_DEFAULT_BRANCH_MODE=fail);
#   `api repos/*/rulesets` and its detail answer ruleset 1 carrying the
#   copilot_code_review rule — STUB_RULESET_INCLUDE / STUB_RULESET_EXCLUDE are
#   its space-separated ref_name conditions and STUB_RULESET_DETAIL_MODE=fail
#   fails its detail read; STUB_RULESET2_INCLUDE / STUB_RULESET2_EXCLUDE give
#   ruleset 2, walked first, a rule of its own. STUB_RULESETS_MODE=none drops
#   the rule; fail, denied, not_found and rate_limited fail the listing with a
#   500, a 403, a 404 and a rate-limited 403; paged moves ruleset 1 to a second
#   page that only --paginate reads. Every `pr view` payload carries
#   STUB_BASE_REF.
#   Commit statuses: `api repos/*/commits/<sha>/status` (combined status)
#   answers likewise — STUB_STATUS_MODE=success_at_head/pending_at_head/
#   failure_at_head/error_at_head publishes a "Review Bot" context (older
#   pending entry + newer terminal status, plus an unrelated "Other Status")
#   on headsha1 only; success_stale publishes it on oldsha only. Each status
#   query appends to STUB_STATUS_LOG (when set) so tests can assert the
#   fallback is skipped once a check-run matches.
