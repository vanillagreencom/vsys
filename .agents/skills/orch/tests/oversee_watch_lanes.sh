# One table. A row names a screen (a pane fixture kept whole in `screen`), the
# lane it sits in (the pane's foreground command, its children, the windows
# the server holds), how many passes the watch takes, and the facts the run
# must show; `watch` reads exactly those facts, so a row fails on the fact it
# names. A `cont` row is the next run over the row above it, same state.
