echo "=== a renewal a ceiling lands on finishes, keeps the rotated token and releases the mutex ==="
# `refresh_claude_token` takes that mutex inside a command substitution, which
# a ceiling signals along with the shell that called it: `timeout` signals the
# whole process group. Once the POST is out the endpoint may already have
# rotated the refresh token, so the renewal ignores the ceiling's TERM until
# the rename and a credentials file never keeps a retired token. Left behind, the mutex
# makes every later renewal on that account wait out its whole timeout and
# fail with "another tool holds the credentials lock". Only the mkdir mutex
# can outlive its holder — under flock the kernel releases it — so the probe
# PATH below is the platform this row exists for, built the way
# workflow-state-flockless.sh builds its own: the real PATH minus flock, so it
# stays true as `lanes` changes.
#
# The mutex assertion reads the SETTLED state rather than the instant the
# ceiling returns, through lib/lanes-fixture.sh's `settled_mutex`, the one
# reading of a reaped lock these suites share. The credentials check reads the
# file only once the mutex assertion before it has waited for the release,
# which comes after the rename.
#
# The run gets its own OVERSEE_WATCH_STATE_DIR, because `lanes` also takes the
# host-wide usage mutex under that directory, and the fallback under the
# checkout is shared with every other run on this host.
#
# The library rule has its own rows in file-lock-messages.sh; what those cannot
# reach is whether the SHIPPED caller takes it. The ceiling row below lands
# while the token POST is in flight and the renewal then runs to its end, so
# it executes the line that restores the handlers but no signal reaches that
# line. The change under test is the word itself, so it is pinned as source:
# `trap -` on those signals is what the revert would put back.
#
# The invariant is the renewal's alone — no clearing to the default disposition
# while it holds the mkdir mutex — so the pin reads that function's body and no
# other line of the script. Sites outside it hold no mutex and arm and clear
# handlers of their own, the host-accounts read being one, and a pin over the
# whole file reds on a neighbour that never touched this rule. The body is read
# out of the shipped script rather than named by line number.
