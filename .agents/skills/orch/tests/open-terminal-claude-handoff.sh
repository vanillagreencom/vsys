# Tests for the claude handoff lane emitted by open-terminal.
#
# Two constraints the claude arms hold:
#
# 1. A handoff session that boots in default (prompting) mode stalls on its
#    FIRST tool call with nobody attached, so launch-only autonomy needs a
#    permission-mode argument. Model, effort, and permission posture arrive as
#    --launch-flags, chosen per task at launch time rather than stored
#    anywhere, and a lane whose flags carry no permission bypass must warn
#    that handoff autonomy is void.
#
# 2. The brief (initial '/orch start …' prompt) rides as a CLI arg; first-run
#    dialogs (theme/trust/browser-integration) consume it, leaving a healthy
#    TUI at an EMPTY composer. The tmux path must verify the launch took by
#    re-capturing the pane — the brief delivered (on a line other than the
#    echoed launch command, with a response begun), or a turn in flight —
#    re-send the brief once if neither shows, and emit a per-lane failure +
#    nonzero exit if it still does not. A pane running a turn is a launched
#    lane, reported as launched and never typed into. A first-run dialog is
#    not, and animating a spinner does not make it one.
#
# The test runs a byte-identical copy of open-terminal inside a temp git repo
# so `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` resolves to a hermetic PROJECT_ROOT, and
# stubs the worktree CLI, gh, ghostty (captures the composed GUI command), and
# tmux (logs every call; serves scripted capture-pane screens) so no real
# harness is ever launched.
#
# One table: a row names the launch mode, the environment, the --launch-flags
# value, the screens the tmux stub serves in order, and the facts the launch
# must show; `observe` reads exactly those facts, so a row fails on the fact
# it names. The one probe outside the table runs a captured GUI command for
# real to read back the argv claude receives.
