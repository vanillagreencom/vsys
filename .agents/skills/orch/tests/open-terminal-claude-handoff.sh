# Tests for the claude handoff lane emitted by open-terminal.
#
# Two constraints the claude arms hold:
#
# 1. A handoff session that boots in default (prompting) mode stalls on its
#    FIRST tool call with nobody attached, so launch-only autonomy needs a
#    permission-mode argument. Model, effort, and permission posture arrive as
#    --launch-flags, chosen per task at launch time rather than stored
#    anywhere. Each harness row that names a permission posture warns when the
#    launch flags carry none of its accepted spellings.
#
# 2. The brief (initial '/orch start …' prompt) rides as a CLI arg; first-run
#    dialogs (theme/trust/browser-integration) consume it, leaving a healthy
#    TUI at an EMPTY composer. The tmux path must verify the launch took by
#    re-capturing the pane — the brief delivered (on a line other than the
#    echoed launch command, with a response begun), or a turn in flight —
#    re-send the brief once if neither shows, and emit a per-lane failure +
#    nonzero exit if it still does not. A pane running a turn is a launched
#    lane, reported as launched and never typed into. A first-run dialog is
#    not, and animating a spinner does not make it one.
#
# The test runs a byte-identical copy of open-terminal inside a temp git repo
# so `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` resolves to a hermetic PROJECT_ROOT, and
# stubs the worktree CLI, gh, ghostty (captures the composed GUI command), and
# tmux (logs every call; serves scripted capture-pane screens) so no real
# harness is ever launched.
#
# One table: a row names the launch mode, the environment, the --launch-flags
# value, the screens the tmux stub serves in order, and the facts the launch
# must show; `observe` reads exactly those facts, so a row fails on the fact
# it names. The one probe outside the table runs a captured GUI command for
# real to read back the argv claude receives.

# The brief visible in the transcript on the first verification pass is
# delivery: no re-send, and the capture includes scrollback (-S -), since a
# fast response scrolling the prompt out of the viewport must not read as
# undelivered. A turn in flight is the other, independent proof, whether it
# was running from the first pass or starts while the launcher waits for a
# composer: launched, no re-send, and no further keystroke into a session that
# would take it mid-turn. A first-run dialog is not a turn, however it
# animates. The brief only inside the echoed launch command is what a
# dialog leaves: the launcher waits for a ready composer, sending one
# dismissing Enter per dialog pass, types the brief once after readiness
# (bare Enters: one at launch, one per dialog nudge, one submitting the
# re-send; the verify loop consumes one screen per second before the
# composer wait begins, so two dialog passes take five echo screens), and fails the lane loudly if the re-sent brief never shows as
# submitted, or the composer never becomes ready. Unsent composer text is
# not delivery either, nor a brief with no response begun. Each tmux step is
# checked, and each failure names its own cause: a window never created, or launch keystrokes that failed on a
# briefless lane, is a failed lane, never a launched one.
