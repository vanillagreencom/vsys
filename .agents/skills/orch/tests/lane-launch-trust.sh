# Tests for the folder trust a launch needs before it reads the arguments it
# was launched with: lib/lane-launch.sh's lane_trust_prepare, its codex and
# claude arms, and the two launchers that refuse rather than open a pane on
# the question.
#
# A Codex session started into a directory its config does not trust stops on
# `Do you trust the contents of this directory?` and waits; a Claude session
# stops on `Do you trust the files in this folder?`. Every unattended launch —
# an overseer succession, a lane opened into a worktree nothing has trusted
# yet — has nobody at that pane, so the launch is spent on a question. The
# sections here are that contract:
#
#   § prepare   one row per shape the configs a launch reads can be in — the
#               account's own, and the private home's where one already stands
#               — each asserted on the EFFECTIVE config a launch would open,
#               through the production reader rather than a second scanner here
#   § claude    one row per shape the config dir's .claude.json can be in,
#               asserted on the file the launch would read, and the dispatcher
#               that hands each harness to its arm
#   § form      the private home is reached by the environment variable that
#               names it, even on a machine whose account launcher is on PATH,
#               with the account dir beside it as the inverse
#   § refuse    a home that cannot be built ends as a refusal, and both
#               launchers carry that refusal's key
#   § account   the readers that ask which account a session is spending get
#               the account back, whatever CODEX_HOME holds
#   § control   one must-fail inverse per function under test: the
#               preparation reads its entry back before the launch, the form
#               never reaches the private home through an account launcher,
#               and the account reader names the account a home sits under

#   tables    how many tables in it name the launch directory; a second one is

#             directory's own in the account config, or none where the account
#             carried no such pair. The drop takes one table and stops at the
#             next header; one that ran to the end of the file would leave the
