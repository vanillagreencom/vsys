# Tests for the folder trust a codex launch needs before it reads the arguments
# it was launched with: lib/lane-launch.sh's lane_codex_trust_prepare, and the
# two launchers that refuse rather than open a pane on the question.
#
# A Codex session started into a directory its config does not trust stops on
# `Do you trust the contents of this directory?` and waits. Every unattended
# launch — an overseer succession, a lane opened into a worktree nothing has
# trusted yet — has nobody at that pane, so the launch is spent on a question.
# The sections here are that contract:
#
#   § prepare   one row per shape the configs a launch reads can be in — the
#               account's own, and the private home's where one already stands
#               — each asserted on the EFFECTIVE config a launch would open,
#               through the production reader rather than a second scanner here
#   § form      the private home is reached by the environment variable that
#               names it, even on a machine whose account launcher is on PATH,
#               with the account dir beside it as the inverse
#   § refuse    a home that cannot be built ends as a refusal, and both
#               launchers carry that refusal's key
#   § account   the readers that ask which account a session is spending get
#               the account back, whatever CODEX_HOME holds
#   § control   six must-fail inverses, one per rule: the entry is read back
#               before the launch, the directory's own table is replaced and
#               never duplicated, the private home is never reached through an
#               account launcher, a home names the account it sits under, an
#               answer recorded in the private home is read, and the account's
#               own transcript store is made before the link loop
