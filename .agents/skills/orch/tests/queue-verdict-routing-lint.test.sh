# Every verdict `queue-wait --json` can produce has a route in `merge-pr.md`
# § 5 step 1, and every row of that table names a verdict queue-wait can
# produce. The lane blocks on the wait and routes what it prints with nothing
# in between, so a producer verdict with no row is a lane that stops at a value
# it cannot act on, and a row naming no producer is a route nothing reaches.
#
# The producer set is read from queue-wait's CODE — the literal every
# `emit_result` and `note_candidate` call site names — not from its `--help`.
# Harvesting the help text makes this a doc-vs-doc check: change an emit site
# and leave the help alone and both directions stay green while the lane hits a
# verdict with no route and the table keeps a dead row, which is the pair of
# failures this file exists to prevent. The help's own `"verdict":` enum is
# checked against the code separately, so the claim that it is the complete set
# is enforced rather than trusted. Every list is read at run time and none is
# written down here.
#
# One row per verdict is checked separately. Coverage is a set question and
# cannot see multiplicity: split a verdict across two rows and deleting either
# one leaves both directions green.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO is pin the workflow's prose or its command lines.
# This suite does not assert that a sentence or invocation has fixed wording.
# The routing table is data — a set of verdict names — and that
# set is the whole of what is checked.
#
# Both trees are read: the sources under skills/ and the committed render under
# .agents/skills/, which is the copy a lane reads. `tools/guard` enforces render
# presence, not byte equality, so the render is read rather than assumed.
