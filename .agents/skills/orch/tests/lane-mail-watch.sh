# lane-mail watch: the lane's standing mailbox monitor. A harness background
# wake (Claude Code Monitor, Pi bg_task) runs it and starts a turn for each
# announcement it prints, and that turn runs the `inbox` command the
# announcement names. Each case starts the real script in the background over a
# lane worktree under TMP_ROOT, appends with the real `send`, and reads what the
# watch printed. Polls are counted from the liveness record the watch rewrites,
# so a row asserting silence waits for polls that ran rather than for a fixed
# time. A tmux on PATH records every call, so a directive that reaches an idle
# lane with no pane write is observed, not assumed. The must-fail controls close
# the file, one per surface: the watch verb, and the send receipt's reading of
# the liveness record the watch writes.
