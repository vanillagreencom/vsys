# Tests for queue-wait's confirmation count against its deadline
# split from the verdict suites at the seam the mechanism draws:
# these cases are about WHEN a candidate is confirmed, not which verdict it
# carries.
#
# The failure this closes: `ejected` and `disarmed` are TRANSITIONS. Each is
# observed once — was_in_queue true then in_queue_now false, was_queued true
# then armed_now false — and a re-run of queue-wait starts with those priors
# false, so a candidate the deadline cut off mid-confirmation is re-observed
# by nobody: the caller re-runs, reads `not_queued`, and merge-pr's table
# re-arms a PR the queue already threw out. `conflicting` is read from
# `mergeable` on every poll and a re-run sees it again, which is why the loss
# is these two and not that one.
#
# Covered:
#   1. an ejection standing at the deadline is polled to its confirmation
#      inside the budget, and routes `ejected`
#   2. the same for the auto-merge-cleared disarm
#   3. the budget is still the upper bound: max_wait is not overrun
#   4. a blip is still not routed, shortened gap or not
#   5. the count is still the whole rule: a candidate that cannot reach it
#      even shortened is reported beside the timeout, never as a verdict
#   6. the squeeze allowance is per candidate verdict, so a transition
#      arriving after a prior candidate spent it is still confirmed
#
#   7. a transition whose owed polls fit the budget exactly is squeezed
#      anyway, because a gap landing ON the deadline is a poll never made
