# Tests for orch/scripts/lib/lane-state.sh: the ONE judge of what a lane is
# doing, and the production callers that must not disagree about it.
#
# Before this library there were three judges — oversee-watch read the pane
# screen, `open-terminal --wake` read /proc, and oversee-succeed read the
# working predicate alone — and the first two answered differently about the
# same lane inside one minute. The sections here are that contract:
#
#   § states     one row per state the judge can name, over pane screens and
#                process observations, each row the inverse of its neighbours
#   § observe    what lane_pane_observe hands the judge, and what it refuses
#                to hand it
#   § agreement  one screen read by BOTH the watch and the wake. The pane rungs
#                are shared, so above idle the two answer the same word; the
#                idle rung falls through to the harness-process read that only
#                the wake makes, and a box with no /proc parts them there
#   § verb       `lanes state` as the third caller: the wiring around the judge,
#                and the host probe that reports beside the state, never as it
#   § control    the must-fail inverse: a judge that reads the harness process
#                and not the pane — the wake as it was — calls the idle screen
#                unjudged
#
# The sandbox, its tmux and pgrep stubs and its assertions are
# lib/oversee-watch-harness.sh, the same ones the watch's own suites drive, so
# no screen or process here is a second fixture of something already measured.
