# Review gate and waiter reference

Cross-script routing behind the gate-mode summary and the `approval-wait` / `ci-wait` / `queue-wait` rows in [../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md). Each script's `--help` is its authoritative contract — arguments, modes, settings, JSON fields, exit codes; nothing here restates one.

## Gate-mode routing

Read the effective reviewer-gate mode ONLY through `approval-wait <PR#> --resolve-mode`, never re-derive it, and never auto-detect the mode from the requested-reviewer list. GitHub's approval requirement on the pull request's base decides it, read two ways: the resolver reads the base and the pull request's `reviewDecision` in one `gh pr view` call, then every ruleset rule GitHub applies to that branch through `rules/branches`, organization rulesets included. That rules read does not show classic branch protection; the `reviewDecision` does, since GitHub sets it only where the base requires a review. A non-zero exit is no mode: report it and stop rather than pick one. It prints:

| `GATE_MODE` | Meaning | Route |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| `approval` | the base's `pull_request` rules require at least one approval, or the pull request's `reviewDecision` is non-empty | `approval-wait` |
| `off` | the base's rulesets require no approval (no `pull_request` rule, or one requiring 0) and the pull request's `reviewDecision` is empty | skip the wait; record the gate not-applicable |

Under `off`, open review threads still stop the merge: submit-pr's gate 3 applies, and so do the readers [thread-read.md § What reads an open thread](thread-read.md#what-reads-an-open-thread) lists. Required CI checks, commit guards, exact-head checks and conflict refusal are untouched in both modes, and the merge path still refuses a `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review at its readiness check. In `approval` mode an unresolved thread holds the wait at `comments` even beside an approval, because orch's own merge gates refuse an open thread: submit-pr's gate 3 and merge-pr's thread read ([thread-read.md](thread-read.md)). A base rule refuses one too where it requires thread resolution.

The reviewer-gate settings, `PR_REVIEW_ON_TIMEOUT` and `PR_REVIEW_WAIT_SECS`, live in `kendex.settings.toml` `[env]`; semantics and defaults are in `approval-wait --help`. The gate predicate, writer, and engine-side `REVIEW_GATE_*` keys belong to the review-gate skill (its SKILL.md and `.agents/skills/review-gate/references/settings.md`).

## Which waiter answers which state

| Waiting on | Tool |
|------------|------|
| Reviewer verdict on one PR | `approval-wait` — statuses `approved`/`changes_requested`/`comments`/`timeout`/`proceeded`/`unreviewable`/`error` |
| CI on one PR | `ci-wait` — verdicts `pass`/`fail`/`pending`/`none` |
| Merge-queue / auto-merge outcome | `queue-wait` — the growing verdict set documented in its § Verdicts table |
| Many PRs, long horizon | `pr-watch.sh` — § Multi-PR watching |

Per-verdict routing lives in the workflows (`submit-pr.md` § 4, `merge-pr.md` § 5); each verdict's semantics live in that script's `--help`.

A wait is a running waiter, never a session sitting at its prompt.

## Stacked pull requests

`approval-wait` returns `unreviewable` (exit 1) when the deadline passes with no reviewer evidence and the PR's base sits outside the target set of the repo's automatic-review rulesets. Nothing was going to arrive on its own. Which bases draw an automatic review is per-repo configuration, read from the repo's rulesets: the review-gate skill's `.agents/skills/review-gate/references/automatic-review.md`.

Work the chain in this order:

1. Request the review by hand on the stacked PR. This is the remedy, not a workaround:

   ```bash
   gh pr edit [PR_NUMBER] --add-reviewer @copilot
   ```

   Then re-run the wait. It works on a base the ruleset does not target.

2. Merge the bottom of the stack. GitHub retargets the next PR onto the new base, but a retarget is not a documented review trigger: request the review by hand as in step 1, or push a new head where the rule's `review_on_push` is on, then re-run the wait.
3. Fallback, only when the manual request draws nothing: close the PR and open a fresh one against the default branch. Close-and-open, never reopen — reopening re-arms the reviewer only on a PR it has already reviewed once, and does nothing for one it never reviewed.

## Waiter auth ladder

All three waiters share `scripts/lib/gh-auth.sh`, wrapping the GitHub skill's helpers: env-first, each candidate source probed at most once (an env token check killed at its bound is asked again once), exit `3` on hard auth failure. Summary in each `--help`; full ladder in [DEVELOPMENT.md § GitHub auth ladder](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/kendex/blob/main/skills/orch/DEVELOPMENT.md#github-auth-ladder).

## Multi-PR watching

The waiters above are single-PR blocking waits. For many PRs across a long horizon, the review-gate skill (optional dependency) ships `scripts/pr-watch.sh`, a needs-attention reducer — contract in `pr-watch.sh --help`, wrap-in-anything loop in review-gate's adoption guide. Orch consumes it through `oversee-watch` when the script is installed. Each pass reads GitHub's review state for every open PR, its unresolved threads, `reviewDecision`, auto-merge arm and merge-queue entry, and writes nothing. The fallback without it is per-PR `approval-wait`/`queue-wait`. `queue-wait` watches only the one PR it is given and only while it runs, so the fallback gives no standing view across PRs and no `awaiting-stale` report. A PR that no waiter watches warrants a manual read of `gh pr view [N] --json reviewDecision,autoMergeRequest` and its queue entry.
