# Codex runtime reference

Deep halves of the Codex notes in [../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md). Everything here is Codex-specific.

## Shell approval by launch mode

In the check below, Codex refused a command for one of three causes: an execpolicy rule match, its built-in `rm -f` check, or the sandbox. It refused no shell form. A redirect, a pipeline, a `;` list, `$(...)`, a heredoc, a `for` loop, an env-assignment prefix, a literal backtick and `git rebase` each ran in every mode, as far as the sandbox let it write.

| Mode | Where kendex launches it | Probe flags | Sandbox | `rm -f` |
|------|--------------------------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Bypass | Lanes: the spelling [lane-launch.sh](../scripts/lib/lane-launch.sh) writes | `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` | None | Refused |
| `never`, full access | The user config default, `approval_policy = "never"` with `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"`; `-a never` on that config | None, on a config holding `approval_policy = "never"` and `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"` | None | Refused |
| `never`, workspace-write | `-a never` on a config whose sandbox is `workspace-write` | `-c approval_policy='"never"' -s workspace-write` | A write outside the working directory fails `Read-only file system` | Refused |
| Approve for me | Lanes: the accepted spelling `--approve-for-me` | `--approve-for-me` | workspace-write; a write outside the working directory failed, then its reviewed escalation ran | Reviewed, then ran |
| Read-only | second-opinion: `codex exec -s read-only` | `-s read-only` | Every write fails `Read-only file system` | Refused |

### Refusals

| Cause | Text the tool returns | Action |
|-------|-----------------------|--------|
| An execpolicy rule with `decision="prompt"` matched; observed in bypass and `never`, full access | `approval required by policy, but AskForApproval is set to Never` | Do not retry and do not wait: no approval can arrive. The rule matches a command prefix, not a shell form. Rules live in `$CODEX_HOME/rules/*.rules` and the project's `.codex/rules/*.rules`; `codex execpolicy check --rules <file> <command words>` prints the matching rule. Run the replacement the rule's owner names, or report a blocker. |
| The built-in `rm -f` check, in every mode but approve for me | `rm -f style commands are not permitted. Use a safer approach` | Drop `-f`: `rm <path>` passed the check in every mode. |
| The sandbox, in the workspace-write and read-only modes | `Read-only file system` | Read-only writes nothing. Workspace-write writes inside the working directory; a write outside it is a blocker. |
| A kendex PreToolUse hook, in every mode | `Command blocked by PreToolUse hook: <hook>: ...` | Use the accepted form the hook names. The project's `.codex/hooks.json` lists the hooks; each refuses a named command, and none refuses a shell form. |

### Check

Observed with `codex-cli 0.157.1`. Each mode ran one `codex exec` whose prompt listed these commands, one shell tool call each, in a scratch directory under `tmp/` that holds a one-commit git repository `repo`:

| Shape | Command | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Redirect | `echo probe > redirect.txt` | Ran; read-only failed `Read-only file system` |
| Pipeline | `printf 'a\nb\n' \| wc -l` | Ran |
| `;` list | `echo one; echo two` | Ran |
| Substitution | `echo "$(printf sub)"` | Ran |
| Heredoc | `cat <<'EOF' > heredoc.txt`, one body line, `EOF` | Ran; read-only failed |
| Loop | `for i in 1 2; do echo "$i"; done` | Ran |
| Env prefix | `PROBE_VAR=1 printenv PROBE_VAR` | Ran |
| Backtick | ``grep -c '`' prompt-copy.txt`` | Ran |
| Rebase | `git -C repo rebase HEAD` | Ran; read-only failed on the ref lock |
| `rm -f` | `rm -f redirect.txt heredoc.txt` | Refused, except in approve for me |
| Rule match | `git -C repo rebase HEAD`, with `.codex/rules/probe.rules` in the scratch directory holding `prefix_rule(pattern=["git", "-C", "repo", "rebase"], decision="prompt")` | Refused in bypass and `never`, full access |
| Hook | `pkill -f ken1894-no-such-process`, run with `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` | Refused by `block-argv-kill` in bypass and read-only |

```bash
codex exec --json --ephemeral --skip-git-repo-check -C <scratch-dir> <probe-flags> - < <prompt-file>
```

A `command_execution` item with `"status":"completed"` in the `--json` output is a command that ran. Rerun the check after a Codex upgrade, and update these tables when a result changes.

### Substitutes

orch runs one simple command per tool call in every harness ([../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § Harness-Safe Shell). These substitutes keep a command inside that rule; no mode above refuses the forms they replace. In a fenced command, write a backtick in a search pattern with the regex hex escape `\x60` (`[\x60]` inside a bracket expression) in regex mode; `rg -F` has no escapes:

```bash
rg -n '\x60kendex refresh\x60' skills/
```

- Polling loops → the orch waiters `ci-wait`, `approval-wait`, `queue-wait`, launched through [Waiter launch](waiter-launch.md). Save its detach command with the harness file-write tool, then invoke the saved script as one simple command. Use the harness wait mechanism to poll the completion file.
- Multi-item sweeps → one simple command per item.
- Derived values → helper scripts (`git-context`, `workflow-state`), never substitution.
- File writes → harness file tools, `apply_patch`, or a direct redirect such as `echo value > path` where the sandbox allows the write. Never wrap a write in a Python subprocess.
- Related `workflow-state` operations → one `get '{...}'` or one `update '... | ...'`. Split what cannot collapse — `set-git-head`/`set-now` (they compute their own value), a read mixed with a write, a `// empty` default that would collapse a combined object, a per-item loop — into separate one-command calls.
- Several file reads → separate read commands or the harness file-read tool.
- An optional environment variable affecting a command → omit the option and let the script auto-detect, or read it with `printenv VAR` and run a second command with a literal value. Never put an unset-variable expansion in a required command.

### Env-assignment prefixes

The prefix is an environment precondition, not part of the required command — normalize it where the command is accepted into the workflow, before any agent is asked to run it. `printenv VAR` confirms ordinary variables; `locale` confirms locale variables by their effective `LC_*` lines (an unset `LC_ALL` with an effective `C` locale satisfies `LC_ALL=C`). `env VAR=value cmd args` is not an accepted shape. If the ambient environment does not satisfy the precondition, report a blocker instead of running under the wrong environment.

### Rule-refused porcelain

Where an execpolicy rule refuses top-level `git rebase`, no user authorization or delegation lifts the refusal. The replacement for a clean linear issue branch is the worktree skill's guarded `create <ID> --reuse --replay` (or `--restack --replay` to pause on conflicts) with `worktree restack continue|skip|abort` — worktree SKILL.md § Policy-blocked rebase (cherry-pick replay fallback) — never an improvised force-push. A dirty tree or merge commits in range put the branch outside that recipe: report a blocker.

## Standing watch

Codex starts no turn for output that arrives after a turn ended, from a detached process or from a running exec session. The oversee watch ([watch-delivery.md](watch-delivery.md)) is held inside the turn by the unified exec tools. The limits are the Codex CLI tool descriptions (0.156.1):

| Step | Call | Limit |
|------|------|-------|
| Arm | `exec_command`, `cmd` the numbered follow command of [watch-delivery.md](watch-delivery.md), `yield_time_ms` 30000 | `yield_time_ms` takes 250-30000 ms. The call returns the first output and a `session_id` while the follow runs. |
| Wait | `write_stdin` on that `session_id`, empty `chars`, `yield_time_ms` 300000 | An empty poll waits 5000-300000 ms; `background_terminal_max_timeout` sets the ceiling, 300000 by default. It returns the output written since the previous call. |
| Re-arm | The same `write_stdin` again, in the same turn, once every returned line is handled | Never end the turn between polls while a lane record is `running`. Every poll return, empty, with output or with an `exit_code`, is an expiry: run the watch-delivery.md checks before the next poll. An `exit_code` ended the follow: arm again from the line after the last number handled. |

Each call is one simple command, as orch's one-simple-command rule asks ([../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § Harness-Safe Shell).

## Lane mailbox

A Codex lane arms no mailbox monitor ([watch-delivery.md § Lane mailbox monitor](watch-delivery.md#lane-mailbox-monitor)): a lane idle at its prompt holds no turn, and Codex starts none for a monitor's output. The overseer follows each `lane-mail send` to a Codex lane with `open-terminal --wake` ([oversee.md § Talking to a lane](../workflows/oversee.md#talking-to-a-lane)), which resumes the lane's newest session in print mode with one line that runs `lane-mail inbox`. Codex publishes no idle signal, so the wake refuses a lane whose Codex process still runs, as `working` or `unjudged` ([lane-reach.md § Wake refusals](lane-reach.md#wake-refusals)). The wake refuses a hosted Codex lane as `wake-invalid`. Mail to a Codex lane the wake refuses takes [lane-reach.md § Mail the wake cannot deliver](lane-reach.md#mail-the-wake-cannot-deliver).

## Spawning Codex collaboration agents

Spawn generated agents with `fork_context: false` — a full-history fork inherits the parent agent type and the runtime rejects the spawn. Resolve parameters with `scripts/spawn-adapter spawn <canonical-agent-name>`: the canonical hyphenated name is the identity everywhere orch records anything, and the adapter confines the runtime spelling to `record.runtime_metadata`. `--fallback-reason` is for a deliberate generic-worker fallback, never one a name-schema rejection caused. After the spawn, `send_input` a `DELEGATION:`-prefixed `<delegation_format>`.

`scripts/spawn-adapter slots` prints the effective thread cap and the `REVIEWER_SLOT_BUDGET` it implies, warning when only the legacy key is set (it is ignored); a running session keeps its old cap until restarted. Set the reported budget in `kendex.settings.toml` `[env]`.

## Codex Desktop app handoff

`workflows/handoff.md` with `harness=codex-app`, the default for multi-issue handoff when the runtime exposes `codex_app` thread tools. Create exactly one thread per issue with `codex_app.create_thread`, targeting a worktree environment whose `startingState` is `{type: "branch", branchName: "[BASE_BRANCH]"}` from `resolve-base-branch`. Start it with `$orch start [ISSUE_ID]` or `$orch start github [OWNER/REPO]#[N]`, and record the returned thread ID. If the runtime separates creation from prompting, call `codex_app.send_message_to_thread` once with that same prompt.

Use a `working-tree` starting state only when the user explicitly asks for a dirty local snapshot (it can start the child before generated Codex agents are visible, forcing a `worker` fallback). Generated agents must be tracked under `.codex/agents/*.toml` in the saved project branch to be discoverable: setup hooks and worktree symlinks run too late.

The Codex CLI does not expose these tools. Do not emulate app handoff with terminal launch, `codex debug app-server`, raw `codex app-server`, or manual app-thread instructions.
