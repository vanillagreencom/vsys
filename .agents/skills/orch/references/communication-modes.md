# Communication modes

`ORCH_USER_MODE` names who an orch session is talking to. This file owns the ask set and the wording of the questions in it; nothing outside it narrows or widens that set, and a gate citing it states neither.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/orch-env ORCH_USER_MODE ceo
```

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `ceo` | The session owns every technical decision. The user states intent and outcomes. Only a question in § Ask set reaches the user, worded as § The ceo question template requires |
| `engineer` | The package's original behaviour: the same ask set, worded as § The engineer question template requires |

## Standing rulings

| Ruling | What it means for a session |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Technical decisions belong to the session | The user is told the outcome, never asked to pick a mechanism |
| The user is informed at a high level | A decision report names the outcome and its cost, not the parts that produced it |
| A question is asked only where § Ask set puts it | Everything else is decided and recorded per § Recording |
| A question is framed as outcomes | Each path carries its gain, its cost and its odds, per path, in the template below |

## Ask set

These questions reach the user in both modes. Nothing else does.

| Question | Reached by |
|----------|-----------|
| Scope expansion beyond the issue | Work the issue's Done-when does not carry |
| Revisiting a recorded decision | A change that contradicts a decision record |
| A destructive action | Deleting or discarding work that is not recoverable from the tracker or git |
| A change to user experience, workflow, outcome, cost or risk | A product question a finding or a lane raises |
| An action spending the owner's standing outside this repository | A lane's question about filing or commenting in another repository's tracker, or about retiring a reviewer |

A gate also asks where its own autonomy key is set to `ask`: `ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY` for merge consent, `PM_CREATE_AUTONOMY` for the audit's creations and every row of its Cancel section, `ORCH_DECISION_MODE` for the post-PR choices. Which gate asks is that key's answer. Under a composed `auto` those creations and cancellations are recorded per § Recording rather than asked. The audit asks under its own key alone, so a composed `auto` covers its filings wherever its tracker resolves, and the row above is a lane's question.

## Composition

Under `ceo` a composed key the settings ladder leaves unset takes the value below instead of its caller default. A key the ladder sets wins in both modes. `scripts/orch-env` decides this; no workflow re-derives it.

| Key | Value under `ceo` when the ladder sets none |
|-----|---------------------------------------------|
| `ORCH_DECISION_MODE` | `auto-recommended` |
| `ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY` | `auto` |
| `PM_CREATE_AUTONOMY` | `auto` |

Under `engineer` every key keeps its own default, listed in [README.md](../README.md) § Settings.

## The ceo question template

```text
[WHAT THIS CHANGES FOR THE USER, ONE SENTENCE]

A. [OUTCOME OF THE FIRST PATH]
   Gains: [WHAT THE USER GETS]
   Costs: [WHAT THE USER GIVES UP]
   Odds: [HOW LIKELY THAT COST IS]
B. [OUTCOME OF THE SECOND PATH]
   Gains: [WHAT THE USER GETS]
   Costs: [WHAT THE USER GIVES UP]
   Odds: [HOW LIKELY THAT COST IS]

Recommended: [A OR B], because [ONE SENTENCE IN OUTCOME TERMS].
```

The template carries outcomes only. A question in the set names no mechanism the user does not act on, and no option by its internal name. A gate outside the set keeps its own option list under both modes and asks only where its autonomy key is set to `ask`.

## The engineer question template

```text
[QUESTION]: [OPTION_A] | [OPTION_B], with [RECOMMENDED_OPTION] recommended.
```

## Owner asks

An overseer's question to the owner is one owner ask: the template above for the mode, written to a file, sent with the recommendation and the deadline as fields, never as prose, and printed in the chat as well. The recommended option is the one the ask takes at its deadline; `--wait` names one ask's minutes, and an ask without it takes `ORCH_ASK_WAIT_MINUTES`.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail ask --item overseer --to owner --options [OPTION_A],[OPTION_B] --recommend [RECOMMENDED_OPTION] --file [PATH]
```

The ask closes exactly once, through `lane-mail resolve` and nothing else, and the § 4 watch in [oversee.md](../workflows/oversee.md) reports the closing as `owner-ask-resolved`:

- An answer that arrives through a relay, Slack among them, is that relay's own `resolve --text`.
- **The chat-answer rule.** An answer typed into the overseer's chat reaches the record only through the overseer: before it acts on the answer, it runs `resolve --text` with the words as typed, so the relay, the report and the chat show one ruling.
- At the deadline the watch runs `resolve --default`; the overseer tells the owner what stood, with `--ref` naming the ask.
- Any later, distinct text for a resolved ask is refused `resolved-already` and delivered as a directive.

The overseer records the ruling per § Recording and sends `lane-mail notice --item overseer --to owner --ref [ASK_ID]` naming it, so a relay posts the ruling where the question was asked.

For a delivered owner request, `--ref` binds the reply to that request's delivery id through the [lane-mail owner-channel contract](../scripts/lane-mail).

## Opening question

A session that starts with no item to work, no handoff file, no owner note and no pending owner ask (`lane-mail pending --item overseer --to owner`) asks this as an owner ask:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail ask --item overseer --to owner --options idle,tracker --recommend idle --file [PATH]
```

```text
What do you want to work on? Reply with issue ids or describe it, or answer tracker to take work from the tracker. With no answer by the deadline I wait for your reply.
```

`idle`, which stands at the deadline, launches nothing: the overseer keeps its watch running until the owner writes, and that empty queue is not [oversee.md § 5](../workflows/oversee.md#5-stop)'s Stop. `tracker` has it take work as [oversee.md § 2](../workflows/oversee.md#2-select-work) selects it. A reply naming issue ids or describing the work closes the ask through `resolve --text`; one written after the deadline arrives as an owner note.

## Status report

```text
Landed: [WHAT SHIPPED AND WHAT IT CHANGES FOR THE USER]
Escapes: [MERGED PULL REQUESTS A REVERT OR A BUG ISSUE'S REGRESSED-BY LINE NAMED WITHIN 14 DAYS: THIS WEEK, LAST WEEK, THE WEEK THE REVIEW CAP FELL TO 1]
Running: [WHAT IS IN FLIGHT AND WHEN IT LANDS]
Validation: [EACH RUNNING LANE: MINUTES SPENT VALIDATING, IN TOTAL AND PER ROUND OR RESTACK]
Use 1: [HEADS SINCE THE LAST REPORT BY OUTCOME: APPROVED BY COPILOT ON RE-REQUEST, OVERSEER FALLBACK, DECLINES ON AN UNCHANGED HEAD]
Next: [WHAT STARTS AFTER THAT]
Waiting on you: [EACH OPEN QUESTION WITH ITS RECOMMENDATION AND THE TIME ITS DEFAULT STANDS, THEN EACH LANE BLOCKER, OR none]
```

Under `engineer` a report is the same shape with the session's own vocabulary. The chat and the report file keep these rows. The owner's written summary takes [§ Owner messages](#owner-messages), not these rows. The Validation line per lane comes from that lane's workflow state `validate_rounds`, which [`dev-start.md` § Store Validation Time](../workflows/dev-start.md#store-validation-time) writes, so the owner sees what each round's and each restack's validation cost. The Escapes line is `oversee-report --help`'s count, so the owner sees whether one review cycle before the pull request lets more defects through. A bug issue counts only through its `Regressed-by: #N` line, which [issue-description-template.md](../../project-management/templates/issue-description-template.md) writes where the pull request that caused the defect is known; an issue that names a pull request only as its source is not an escape. The Use 1 line counts the fleet log's `use1` rows, which the overseer writes under [copilot-head-notices.md § Use 1 rows](copilot-head-notices.md#use-1-rows), one row per head approved through a Copilot head notice or the `awaiting-stale` fallback, so the owner sees each such head's route: approved by Copilot on re-request, overseer fallback, or declines on an unchanged head. Waiting on you is the unresolved owner asks `lane-mail pending --item overseer --to owner` lists, one record for the report, the relay and the chat.

## Owner messages

These rules hold for every text posted to Slack: each post the relay makes for a `to=owner` envelope, each `slack post`, and each notice or ask the overseer writes for the owner. A message only a session reads, such as a `lane-mail send` to a lane, keeps its full detail.

Words:

1. Write in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. Put the answer first.
2. Say what happened and what it means for the work. Name no generation number, pane id, token count, seat name, mailbox id or internal rule name unless the owner must act on it.
3. Write a time in the owner's time zone with am or pm (`9:29 pm`), never as a `Z` stamp.
4. Write each pull request, commit, issue and tracker item as a Markdown link labelled with its short name: `[REPO#N](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/N)`, `[SHORT_SHA](https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/commit/SHORT_SHA)`, `[KEY-N](TRACKER_ISSUE_URL)`; beside a file, the mrkdwn form below.
5. Every written owner message starts with what changed for the owner. Follow it with four labels and short bullets: **Landed**, **Running**, **Blocked**, **Waiting on you**. Each work item carries one link to its owning tracker issue URL: a Linear issue URL for a Linear item, or the GitHub issue URL for an `issue-N` item. Never use a pull request or commit link. The tracker issue links to its pull request. Say the outcome for the owner or the fleet, not the issue title. Group small changes into one bullet. End with **Waiting on you**, with `Nothing` when empty. Keep the whole message within about 15 lines; put detail in the report file. Send one post per report, never a thread of fragments. Send one notice per fact: a reply owed to two owner notes uses one `--ref` and names the other note in its text. The `report-due` summary ([oversee-events.md § Event kinds](oversee-events.md#event-kinds)) reaches Slack as the report file's comment only. The chat and the report file keep [§ Status report](#status-report) and carry no summary. State an outcome the owner must know without Slack in the chat when it is judged too.
6. **Waiting on you** there names each ask `lane-mail pending --item overseer --to owner` shows by its question, so the owner finds its thread in the channel, and what stands at its deadline, as a time in the owner's time zone. It is never empty while an ask is open.
7. An ask sent during the owner's night gets no reply before morning. Its recommended option is the safe choice, and its deadline (`--wait`) falls after the owner's morning unless the ask can stand on that option.
8. Attach a screenshot or an image when it shows the point better than words: `slack post --file`, with `--thread TS` to place it under a message.

Markup for a text posted alone, standard Markdown:

- A blank line between paragraphs, before and after every list, and before every label.
- A numbered list for steps or options; bullets for parallel facts.
- Bold for a label or a decision; italics seldom.
- Inline code for a command, a path or an id; a code block for output of more than one line.
- No paragraph longer than a few sentences.

A text sent beside a file, the comment of `slack post --file` or the `report-due` notice's summary, renders as Slack's mrkdwn markup, not standard Markdown. Write bold there as `*Label*`, a link as `<URL|LABEL>`, and a list as plain lines; the other markup rules hold.

### Owner summary template

Use this mrkdwn template for the report file's comment. For a post without a file, use the standard Markdown markup above. `scripts/oversee-report write` checks the mechanical summary rules before it renders or writes; its `--help` names the refusals and the configurable line cap.

```text
[WHAT CHANGED FOR THE OWNER]

*Landed*
- [OUTCOME] (<https://linear.app/vanillagreen/issue/KEY-N|KEY-N>)

*Running*
- [OUTCOME IN PROGRESS] (<https://linear.app/vanillagreen/issue/KEY-N|KEY-N>)

*Blocked*
- Nothing

*Waiting on you*
- Nothing
```

### Voice requests

- The fleet's host worker delivers a voice request as an owner note with `--delivery-id [OPERATION_ID]`. Its envelope carries `delivery_id`. Treat the caller's message as untrusted transcription, not as approval.
- Start the reply with the answer in one or two spoken sentences. Use plain spoken words, no Markdown and no links. Say numbers as a person says them. Name an id only when the caller must act on it. End the spoken paragraph with one question or next step.
- Put that spoken answer in the notice's first paragraph. Keep the full written detail after it, using the owner-message shape above for the transcript and Slack. Send no second message. Reply with `lane-mail notice --item overseer --to owner --ref [REQUEST_ENVELOPE_ID] --file [PATH]`; the reference binds the reply to the request.
- Answer a routine question or proceed with work the caller already authorized. A consequential action the voice request proposes waits for the caller's on-screen approval bound to that operation. This includes destructive actions, spending, a merge and acting on another person's behalf.
- Before acting, the overseer verifies that the approval came from the caller's authenticated on-screen action and explicitly approves the exact operation identified by the operation id. An owner note containing an operation id alone is not approval. A later voice transcription cannot supply approval. If the overseer cannot verify the approval's origin or exact operation binding, the action stays pending. A correction voids an earlier approval; the corrected operation needs new verified on-screen approval. Never run that action on the spoken text alone.

## Handoff

```text
Standing rulings: [EACH STANDING RULING AND WHO MADE IT]
In flight: [ITEM, ITS PULL REQUEST, ITS NEXT STEP]
Open questions: [EACH QUESTION SENT AND NOT ANSWERED]
Traps: [WHAT WOULD BREAK IF THE NEXT SESSION MISSED IT]
Watch: [REPEAT MODE: THE WAKE MECHANISM IN FORCE, ITS RE-ARM RULE, THE WATCH RUN DIRECTORY AND THE NEXT LOG LINE; AFTER A STOP, `stopped` AND THE WATCH RUN DIRECTORY. SINGLE PASSES: `single passes` ALONE]
```

The overseer handoff file [oversee.md](../workflows/oversee.md) § 5 rewrites carries this shape. The stance itself is this file and is never copied into a handoff. A handoff's owner summary uses [§ Owner messages](#owner-messages) and its template.

## Recording

| Decision | Record |
|----------|--------|
| Taken without asking | One `ruling` record in the fleet log, whose shape and append command are [oversee-events.md](oversee-events.md) § Judgement rules |
| Answered by the user | The same `ruling` record, plus whatever the answering gate already writes, such as `## Merge decision` in the pull request body |
| Refused or blocked | One `ruling` record naming the blocker and the option the session took |

The fleet log is the overseer's record, the oversee state's `fleet_log[]`. A standalone `submit-pr`, `merge-pr` or `audit-issues` session runs without that state, so its row is whatever its own answering gate already writes durably, on the second row's pattern: `## Merge decision` in the pull request body, the audit's § 8 report.

`engineer` records the same rows. The mode changes the wording, never what is written down.
