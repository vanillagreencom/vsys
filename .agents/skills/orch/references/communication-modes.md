# Communication modes

`ORCH_USER_MODE` names who an orch session is talking to. This file owns the ask set and the wording of the questions in it; nothing outside it narrows or widens that set, and a gate citing it states neither.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/orch-env ORCH_USER_MODE ceo
```

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `ceo` | The session owns every technical decision. The user states intent and outcomes. Only a question in § Ask set reaches the user, worded as § The ceo question template requires |
| `engineer` | The package's original behaviour: the same ask set, worded as § The engineer question template requires |

## Standing rulings

| Ruling | What it means for a session |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Technical decisions belong to the session | The user is told the outcome, never asked to pick a mechanism |
| The user is informed at a high level | A decision report names the outcome and its cost, not the parts that produced it |
| A question is asked only where § Ask set puts it | Everything else is decided and recorded per § Recording |
| A question is framed as outcomes | Each path carries its gain, its cost and its odds, per path, in the template below |

## Ask set

These questions reach the user in both modes. Nothing else does.

| Question | Reached by |
|----------|-----------|
| Scope expansion beyond the issue | Work the issue's Done-when does not carry |
| Revisiting a recorded decision | A change that contradicts a decision record |
| A destructive action | Deleting or discarding work that is not recoverable from the tracker or git |
| A change to user experience, workflow, outcome, cost or risk | A product question a finding or a lane raises |
| An action spending the owner's standing outside this repository | A lane's question about filing or commenting in another repository's tracker, or about retiring a reviewer |

A gate also asks where its own autonomy key is set to `ask`: `ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY` for merge consent, `PM_CREATE_AUTONOMY` for the audit's creations and every row of its Cancel section, `ORCH_DECISION_MODE` for the post-PR choices. Which gate asks is that key's answer. Under a composed `auto` those creations and cancellations are recorded per § Recording rather than asked. The audit asks under its own key alone, so a composed `auto` covers its filings wherever its tracker resolves, and the row above is a lane's question.

## Composition

Under `ceo` a composed key the settings ladder leaves unset takes the value below instead of its caller default. A key the ladder sets wins in both modes. `scripts/orch-env` decides this; no workflow re-derives it.

| Key | Value under `ceo` when the ladder sets none |
|-----|---------------------------------------------|
| `ORCH_DECISION_MODE` | `auto-recommended` |
| `ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY` | `auto` |
| `PM_CREATE_AUTONOMY` | `auto` |

Under `engineer` every key keeps its own default, listed in [README.md](../README.md) § Settings.

## The ceo question template

```text
[WHAT THIS CHANGES FOR THE USER, ONE SENTENCE]

A. [OUTCOME OF THE FIRST PATH]
   Gains: [WHAT THE USER GETS]
   Costs: [WHAT THE USER GIVES UP]
   Odds: [HOW LIKELY THAT COST IS]
B. [OUTCOME OF THE SECOND PATH]
   Gains: [WHAT THE USER GETS]
   Costs: [WHAT THE USER GIVES UP]
   Odds: [HOW LIKELY THAT COST IS]

Recommended: [A OR B], because [ONE SENTENCE IN OUTCOME TERMS].
```

The template carries outcomes only. A question in the set names no mechanism the user does not act on, and no option by its internal name. A gate outside the set keeps its own option list under both modes and asks only where its autonomy key is set to `ask`.

## The engineer question template

```text
[QUESTION]: [OPTION_A] | [OPTION_B], with [RECOMMENDED_OPTION] recommended.
```

## Owner asks

An overseer's question to the owner is one owner ask: the template above for the mode, written to a file, sent with the recommendation and the deadline as fields, never as prose, and printed in the chat as well. The recommended option is the one the ask takes at its deadline; `--wait` names one ask's minutes, and an ask without it takes `ORCH_ASK_WAIT_MINUTES`.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail ask --item overseer --to owner --options [OPTION_A],[OPTION_B] --recommend [RECOMMENDED_OPTION] --file [PATH]
```

The ask closes exactly once, through `lane-mail resolve` and nothing else, and the § 4 watch in [oversee.md](../workflows/oversee.md) reports the closing as `owner-ask-resolved`:

- An answer that arrives through a relay, Slack among them, is that relay's own `resolve --text`.
- **The chat-answer rule.** An answer typed into the overseer's chat reaches the record only through the overseer: before it acts on the answer, it runs `resolve --text` with the words as typed, so the relay, the report and the chat show one ruling.
- At the deadline the watch runs `resolve --default`; the overseer tells the owner what stood, with `--ref` naming the ask.
- Any later, distinct text for a resolved ask is refused `resolved-already` and delivered as a directive.

The overseer records the ruling per § Recording and sends `lane-mail notice --item overseer --to owner --ref [ASK_ID]` naming it, so a relay posts the ruling where the question was asked.

## Opening question

A session that starts with no item to work, no handoff file, no owner note and no pending owner ask (`lane-mail pending --item overseer --to owner`) asks this as an owner ask:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail ask --item overseer --to owner --options idle,tracker --recommend idle --file [PATH]
```

```text
What do you want to work on? Reply with issue ids or describe it, or answer tracker to take work from the tracker. With no answer by the deadline I wait for your reply.
```

`idle`, which stands at the deadline, launches nothing: the overseer keeps its watch running until the owner writes, and that empty queue is not [oversee.md § 5](../workflows/oversee.md#5-stop)'s Stop. `tracker` has it take work as [oversee.md § 2](../workflows/oversee.md#2-select-work) selects it. A reply naming issue ids or describing the work closes the ask through `resolve --text`; one written after the deadline arrives as an owner note.

## Status report

```text
Landed: [WHAT SHIPPED AND WHAT IT CHANGES FOR THE USER]
Running: [WHAT IS IN FLIGHT AND WHEN IT LANDS]
Validation: [EACH RUNNING LANE: MINUTES SPENT VALIDATING, IN TOTAL AND PER ROUND]
Next: [WHAT STARTS AFTER THAT]
Waiting on you: [EACH OPEN QUESTION, OR none]
```

Under `engineer` a report is the same shape with the session's own vocabulary. A report the overseer writes to the user takes this shape whatever produced its rows. The Validation line per lane comes from that lane's workflow state `validate_rounds`, which [`dev-start.md` § Store Validation Time](../workflows/dev-start.md#store-validation-time) writes, so the owner sees what each round's validation cost. Waiting on you is the unresolved owner asks `lane-mail pending --item overseer --to owner` lists, one record for the report, the relay and the chat.

## Handoff

```text
Standing rulings: [EACH STANDING RULING AND WHO MADE IT]
In flight: [ITEM, ITS PULL REQUEST, ITS NEXT STEP]
Open questions: [EACH QUESTION SENT AND NOT ANSWERED]
Traps: [WHAT WOULD BREAK IF THE NEXT SESSION MISSED IT]
Watch: [REPEAT MODE: THE WAKE MECHANISM IN FORCE, ITS RE-ARM RULE, THE WATCH RUN DIRECTORY AND THE NEXT LOG LINE; AFTER A STOP, `stopped` AND THE WATCH RUN DIRECTORY. SINGLE PASSES: `single passes` ALONE]
```

The overseer handoff file [oversee.md](../workflows/oversee.md) § 5 rewrites carries this shape. The stance itself is this file and is never copied into a handoff.

## Recording

| Decision | Record |
|----------|--------|
| Taken without asking | One `ruling` record in the fleet log, whose shape and append command are [oversee-events.md](oversee-events.md) § Judgement rules |
| Answered by the user | The same `ruling` record, plus whatever the answering gate already writes, such as `## Merge decision` in the pull request body |
| Refused or blocked | One `ruling` record naming the blocker and the option the session took |

The fleet log is the overseer's record, the oversee state's `fleet_log[]`. A standalone `submit-pr`, `merge-pr` or `audit-issues` session runs without that state, so its row is whatever its own answering gate already writes durably, on the second row's pattern: `## Merge decision` in the pull request body, the audit's § 8 report.

`engineer` records the same rows. The mode changes the wording, never what is written down.
