# Pi runtime reference

Deep halves of the Pi (`pi-agents-tmux`) runtime note in [../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md). Everything here is Pi-specific.

## Pane agents (Pi)

Pane agents (`pane: true` in agent frontmatter) live in a persistent tmux pane keyed by agent name; the extension reuses the existing pane on every redelegation. Do not pass `forceSpawn: true` unless you need a fresh pane — it errors if a live pane already exists; drop the flag or `/agents:stop <name>` first. The `taskId` is returned in two places: the structured `taskId` field on the tool result and an inline `Task ID: <id>` line in the assistant-visible content text — read whichever the harness exposes; no follow-up `get_subagent_result` call is needed to learn the id. Store the `taskId` and agent name in workflow state (`child_sessions[agent].agent_id` or `review_agent_ids[...]`).

## Bg agents (Pi)

Bg agents (no `pane: true`) are background one-shot processes. A run without `sessionKey` starts a fresh session file that later calls do not resume; [agent-transcripts.md](agent-transcripts.md) says where round recovery finds it. When the same `reviewer-*` (or other bg agent) must retain conversation context across delegations, pass `sessionKey: "<workflow-scoped-stable-id>"` (e.g. `review-issue-PROJ-123`); the same `agent + sessionKey` resumes the prior pi session, and omitting it keeps the call stateless. Bg agents complete by the final assistant message captured by `subagent`; do not instruct them to call `complete_subagent`.

## Steering and completion recovery (Pi)

On re-delegation to a pane agent, use `steer_subagent` only for true mid-run correction from this same Pi parent session; its success output reads `Bridge: active` and shows the expected child `sessionFile` under this session runtime. If the bridge target is unavailable, the tool queues an inbox fallback that is **not** mid-run steering and is read only when the pane is idle — for idle follow-up work, queue a new `subagent` task to the same pane instead. A running Pi lane that is not this session's child is messaged with `lane-mail send`, never the bridge; the pi-session-bridge CLI reads its state and answers its harness dialogs ([lane-reach.md § Per harness](lane-reach.md#per-harness)).

Use `get_subagent_result` only as a recovery/status reader for missed or truncated pane completions; it does not affect ownership or delivery. If it returns `needs_completion`, the child finished a turn without the durable `complete_subagent` record — do not count it as a return; use the verbose diagnostics/outbox path to send one recovery instruction asking the same pane to call `complete_subagent` for the stored `taskId`. Treat Pi custom completion notifications as agent returns only when the task ID matches stored workflow state; repeated display is not a second return.

## Lane mailbox monitor (Pi)

A Pi lane arms its mailbox monitor ([watch-delivery.md § Lane mailbox monitor](watch-delivery.md#lane-mailbox-monitor)) through the `pi-background-tasks` output wake that [§ Standing watch (Pi)](#standing-watch-pi) also uses.

| Step | Call |
|------|------|
| Arm | `bg_task action: "spawn"` on `lane-mail watch --item [ISSUE_ID]`, with `notifyOnOutput: true`, `notifyMode: "always"` and `notifyOnExit: true`. Keep the pid the spawn returns. |
| Wake | Run the `lane-mail inbox` command the announcement prints, and act on every directive it prints. The inbox is the read; the wake's inline tail only says mail landed. |
| Re-arm | At the "wake budget exhausted" notice, stop the monitor with `bg_status action: "stop"` on the kept pid, then spawn a new one. |
| Exit | An exit with code 2 is a refused watch: follow the refusal rule of [watch-delivery.md § Lane mailbox monitor](watch-delivery.md#lane-mailbox-monitor) and spawn nothing. At every other exit wake, `bg_status action: "list"`, and spawn a new monitor only when the list does not show the kept pid as running. |

## Standing watch (Pi)

The oversee watch ([watch-delivery.md](watch-delivery.md)) reaches a Pi overseer through a `pi-background-tasks` output wake. The spawn parameters are the package's [instructions](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/kendex/blob/main/pi-extensions/pi-background-tasks/instructions.md).

| Step | Call |
|------|------|
| Arm | `bg_task action: "spawn"` on the numbered follow command of [watch-delivery.md](watch-delivery.md), with `notifyOnOutput: true`, `notifyMode: "always"`, `notifyOnExit: true` and `timeoutSeconds: 300`. The timeout is the follow's expiry, where watch-delivery.md checks the watch is alive. Keep the pid the spawn returns (`Started [ID] (pid [PID])`): `bg_status` stops only by `pid`, and the list shows it on each task's line. |
| Read | A wake carries an inline tail capped at `outputAlertMaxChars`, so read the log numbered from the line after the last number handled: `awk 'NR >= [NEXT_LINE] { print NR ": " $0 }' "[RUN_DIR]/watch.log"`. |
| Re-arm | The per-task wake budget ends in one "wake budget exhausted" notice. Stop that follow with `bg_status action: "stop"` on the kept pid, then spawn a new one from the line after the last number handled. |
| Exit | Every exit wake, whatever ended the task: run the watch-delivery.md checks, and while they read a live watch, `bg_status action: "list"`. Spawn a new follow from the line after the last number handled only when the list does not show the kept pid as running. This keeps at most one follow, even after a stop or a replayed wake. |

The `bg_task.*` activity events that pi-session-bridge relays reach external observers only, never this session.
