# Orchestration development

Maintainer notes. Consumer docs: [README.md](README.md); the agent contract: [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

## Tests

```bash
bash skills/orch/tests/run-all.sh
bash skills/orch/tests/run-all.sh workflow_helpers   # subset by name fragment
```

Each `tests/*.sh` is self-contained: it builds its own sandbox with parametrized CLI stubs on `PATH`, prints `pass: N fail: M`, and exits 0 only when every assertion passed. `run-all.sh` discovers them at execution time, so a new suite needs no registration.

Every `tests/*.sh` carries one line directly under its `set -...o pipefail`:

```bash
source "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib/git-env.sh"
```

That lib is where the four git environment variables are cleared, so a new suite adds the line rather than its own `unset`. The position is the rule, not the presence: `git-env-isolation.test.sh` names any file whose line is absent or sits anywhere but directly under the `set`.

Every test the runner discovers ships with the installed skill and must pass in a downstream project with no access to the kendex source checkout. Byte identity and idempotence of what an apply writes are covered upstream of the installed tree, in `crates/core/tests/byte_faithful.rs`.

## Invariants the tests pin

- Round-id identity. Every dev and QA delegation mints a token (`workflow-state new-round-id`, a nanosecond timestamp plus a random suffix) and embeds it; `dev-return-write --round-id RID` writes `tmp/dev-return-[ISSUE]-[RID].json` with `round_id` inside, and `dev-artifact-check --round-id RID` resolves that exact path and requires the internal token to match. There is one identity model, no mtime gate and no positional mode, so a same-second re-stamp, a late-writing timed-out agent, a bundle group-A receipt consumed by group-B, and a cross-round ci-fix receipt are all unmatchable. `dev_delegated_at` remains only as the stall-watchdog deadline. Gate ordering and field rules: `dev-artifact-check --help` and [references/artifact-checks.md](references/artifact-checks.md); schemas in [schemas/](schemas/).
- Command shapes. Lints scan the orch and dev docs for the shapes strict harness classifiers reject inside a fenced `bash`/`sh` block: a literal backtick, and an env-assignment prefix. Each carries planted-control cases proving it still has teeth.
- Reference hygiene. Lints pin that no doc across orch, dev and github routes CI waiting through `github.sh` (the waiter is `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/ci-wait`), and that no orch doc uses an unsupported `decisions issue` lookup shape.
- Help is inert. Every orch CLI that loads project configuration answers a help form before the load. A parser reached by a dry run runs twice, so an arm that returns may only assign; an arm that prints must then exit. Held by `tools/tests/help-inert.test.sh`.
- Inherited git environment. `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_COMMON_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE` and `GIT_INDEX_FILE` outrank `git -C <path>`, so a suite that inherits them builds its fixtures inside the caller's repository and still reports a clean pass. `lib/git-env.sh` clears all four at load. `git-env-isolation.test.sh` holds both halves: it runs `dev_round_gate.sh` with all four exported at a sandbox repository and pins that repository's log and index unchanged, repeating the run against a copied tree whose lib is neutralized to prove the clearing is what holds it; its lint pins the source line's position, with probe files placing the line after the fixture, inside a dead branch, and inside a heredoc body, since each of those runs late or not at all while reading as present.
- Sourced libs inherit that clearing. Every lib under `tests/lib/` that shells out to git does so with a bare `git -C` and is sandboxed only because the suite that sourced it sourced `lib/git-env.sh` first. The lint reaches `tests/*.sh` and not `tests/lib/*.sh`, so a lib added here rests on that precondition rather than on a check.
- Controls. `help-inert.test.sh` plants its own must-fail controls. `workflow-state-state-dir-flag.sh` and `lanes-settings-refusal.sh` do not, so re-run them against the pre-fix file when changing what they cover.
- Waiter contracts. `approval_wait.sh`, `ci_wait.sh` and `queue_wait.sh` exercise the state machines and the shared auth ladder against stubbed `gh`, including the check-run and commit-status evidence surfaces, run correlation across reruns and cancelled siblings, and the queue's cross-poll `WAS_QUEUED` memory. They and the two `queue_wait_*` suites run on `lib/virtual-clock.sh`, whose `date`/`sleep` stubs make a poll budget arithmetic over a file rather than real seconds, so a deadline case cannot race a loaded runner. A case that needs a real wait sets `STUB_CLOCK=` and both stubs fall through; `ci_wait.sh`'s hanging-auth preflight is the only one. A `STUB_CLOCK` naming no file is a broken clock rather than a waiver and both stubs refuse it. `lib/waiter-assertions.sh` holds the suites' shared assertion vocabulary.

## GitHub auth ladder

`approval-wait`, `ci-wait` and `queue-wait` share `scripts/lib/gh-auth.sh`, which wraps the GitHub skill's helpers. Each candidate is probed at most once:

1. Selected env token. `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` set: validate with a bounded `gh api user`.
2. Keyring fallback. That token failing: `env -u GH_TOKEN -u GITHUB_TOKEN gh auth status` once; on success, warn on stderr and unset the stale env token.
3. Bot token. Keyring not recovering: unset the stale env tokens, then load a `GH_BOT_TOKEN` candidate from process env or project config. `op://` references resolve through `op read` only after the final source is selected. The `github.sh` router separately prefers a resolved `GH_BOT_TOKEN` over a resolved `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so bot access is not blocked by a user token.
4. No-env keyring. No env token at startup and no bot token: probe keyring auth once.
5. Hard fail. Nothing works: exit `3` with a diagnostic. Callers never poll against empty output.

`op` CLI service-account setup is outside orch: launchers may inject resolved secrets before starting a harness, and orch preserves those values rather than clobbering them with local `op://` references.

## Git HTTPS fallback

Merge and submit workflows use targeted `origin` operations through the GitHub skill's `scripts/git-https-auth` rather than broad remote enumeration. The helper is a per-command fallback for SSH-backed GitHub remotes: it validates env-token or keyring `gh` auth, then supplies temporary `credential.helper` and `url.insteadOf` config so GitHub SSH URLs work over HTTPS. It persists nothing. Never use `git fetch --all --prune` for PR closure: a secondary remote's SSH failure must not block branch cleanup or tracker closure.

## Reviewer slot budget

`REVIEWER_SLOT_BUDGET` bounds reviewer fanout for runtimes that cap concurrent agent threads. It is the runtime's total agent-session budget counting the primary session; `0` means unlimited. When the reviewer set exceeds the available slots, review workflows run bounded waves and retire each completed session, because a completed subagent thread can keep counting against the cap until it is explicitly shut down. The configured budget is advisory and the runtime cap authoritative: a persistent launch that hits the thread-limit error demotes to waves in place, persists the observed size, and recommends it to the user.

On the Codex collaboration runtime the cap is MultiAgentV2's configurable `features.multi_agent_v2.max_concurrent_threads_per_session`. `spawn-adapter slots` reports the effective cap, warns when only the silently-ignored legacy `agents.max_threads` is set, and notes that a running session keeps the cap it started with. Retiring is safe because review state lives in on-disk artifacts and workflow state, never in reviewer session memory.

## CI triggering

orch orders the review gate before CI verification universally, with no repo detection, so a repo whose CI starts only after a review verdict (approval-gated jobs, or a merge queue) can never deadlock the workflow. On always-on repos the post-gate CI verify returns quickly, and `ci-wait` tolerates dispatch latency through `CI_WAIT_NO_CHECKS_GRACE`.

When the review evidence arrives as a commit status rather than a check-run, no PR workflow trigger fires on it, so a run gated closed while that status was pending recovers only through the repo's own status convergence, or one bounded manual rerun-in-place after the evidence lands. Consuming-repo gate architecture belongs to the review-gate skill; vendor it rather than hand-writing gate jobs.

Reruns re-execute the workflow definition and verifier state pinned at the original triggering event, so a PR that changes gate or CI behavior only exhibits the new behavior on a fresh head. Reruns are for flakes and re-gating unchanged workflows.

## Launch lanes

`lanes` answers which harness account a session should launch under on a machine carrying several. The failure it exists for is account-level: when one account hits its limit mid-fleet, every session on it stalls at once.

- Headroom is `100 - max(session_5h, weekly, model_weekly)`, the binding bucket, never an average. An account at 5% session and 95% weekly has 5% headroom.
- Everything unmeasurable is refused, never assumed idle. A lane is pickable only at `status: ok` with at least one parsed window; `no_credentials`, `expired`, `unreachable`, `no_usage_data` and `error` all yield a null headroom and are skipped. `pick` exits `3` when nothing qualifies, distinct from 1 for a real failure.
- The inventory is discovered; config is only an overlay. `ORCH_LANE_ALIASES` renames discovered lanes, `ORCH_LANE_DIRS` covers a layout discovery cannot reach.
- In-flight launches outrank headroom. `open-terminal` records a claim per tmux lane it launches under a resolved lane; a claim is live while its pane is (`<server pid> <pane id>`, pruned on read), and `pick` takes the fewest live claims first, headroom only breaking the tie, because usage numbers lag a launch by minutes. The threshold is applied first; a claim count never buys a lane past it.
- Token refresh is opt-in. Refreshing rotates the refresh token in a credentials file other tools on the machine share, so `--refresh` opts in and takes a flock, re-reading inside it.
- Two API shapes, one trap each. Claude's model-scoped weekly window lives in `limits[]` entries with `kind == "weekly_scoped"`, not the legacy `seven_day_*` fields: take the most-consumed one and read its label from the response. Codex's `primary_window`/`secondary_window` do not map to session/weekly by position; route each by its own `limit_window_seconds`.
- Testing. The network layer is the only impure part and is injected through `ORCH_LANES_FETCH_CMD`, so the suite runs offline against fixed responses. Bearer tokens never reach argv; they go to curl over stdin with `-K -`.

`open-terminal` takes model, effort and permission flags per launch through `--launch-flags`, validated to plain flag words before interpolation. Nothing stores them: a stored default silently applies yesterday's answer to today's work item.

## Container close

`container-close` owns Linear container closure and `sync-base` owns base resolution, fetch, checkout ownership and the fast-forward. Both contracts are in their own `--help`. Completion validation inside `container-close` must provide Boolean `all_ok`, exactly one typed parent result, and Boolean `has_summary`; the helper never infers that a later child completion came from a parent cascade.

## Codex app worktree routing

Codex Desktop handoff starts each child thread in an app-managed worktree, often on a detached `HEAD`. Generated Codex agents must be tracked under `.codex/agents/*.toml` in the saved project branch to be visible before subagent discovery; local ignored files are not enough, because setup hooks, `WORKTREE_SYMLINKS`, and `codex-setup` all run too late. Create the app worktree from the resolved base branch rather than a controller `working-tree` snapshot, which can start the child before those agents are visible and force a `worker` fallback.

The managed lifecycle relies on committed branch diffs, so `dev-start.md`, `review-pr.md` and `submit-pr.md` reject dirty or detached worktrees before review or submission; otherwise uncommitted edits read as "no changes".
