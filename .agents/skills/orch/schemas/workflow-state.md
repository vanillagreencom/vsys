# Workflow State Schema

Persistent state file for orch workflows. Survives context compaction.

**Location**: `<state-dir>/workflow-state-[ISSUE_ID].json` — `<state-dir>` resolves to the global `--state-dir <path>` flag, then `$ORCH_STATE_DIR`, then `tmp/`.

**Key**: `[ISSUE_ID]` is the workflow-state key whose forms `workflow-state --help` § Keys enumerates, never the bare GitHub issue number. Every `workflow-state` action, `init` included, uses the key exactly as given, so the spelling passed to `init` is the spelling every later command must use.

## Field Definitions

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `issue_id` | string | Parent issue identifier |
| `sub_issues` | string[] | Child issue IDs if bundled |
| `agent` | string | Primary dev agent type |
| `worktree` | string | Absolute path to git worktree |
| `branch` | string | Git branch name |
| `qa_labels` | string[] | QA trigger labels from dev return |
| `near_ceiling` | string[] | `byte-ceiling` `near-ceiling` lines from the last recorded dev return, each naming a file within reach of the byte ceiling. `dev-start.md` § Store Near-Ceiling Lines is the one writer, invoked by the implement and fix accept paths and by the retry path for a structurally valid artifact with a failing `validate`. It REPLACES the list, and a return whose probe did not answer (`near_ceiling: null`) leaves it as it stood: state describes the branch as the last recorded round left it, never an accumulation across rounds. The next round's delegation renders one `Near-ceiling:` line per entry |
| `child_sessions` | object | Per-agent lifecycle keyed by logical agent name: `{agent: {status, agent_id, runtime_agent_type, agent_type_fallback, spawned_at}}`. `status` is `"active"` while the session is live (`dev-start.md` § 2 stamps it at spawn) and `"closed"` once the caller's shutdown step retires it (`start-worktree.md` § 5.5). Reviewer slot accounting treats a record with a missing `status` field as active |
| `review_agents` | string[] | Reviewer names currently expected to stay alive across fix/re-review cycles; in wave mode (`REVIEWER_SLOT_BUDGET` exceeded) only the currently launched wave |
| `review_agent_ids` | object | Reviewer session IDs keyed by name — reuse before spawning `{"name":"id",...}` |
| `review_agent_runtime_types` | object | Reviewer runtime agent metadata keyed by logical reviewer name: `{name: {agent_type, task_name?, fallback}}`; records a Codex `worker` fallback and, when the runtime `task_name` schema forced a hyphens-to-underscores spelling, the translated `task_name` — without changing the logical keys |
| `validate_rounds` | object[] | One `{round_id, kind, mode, seconds}` entry per dev round whose artifact passed the schema gate with a validation wall time, whether the round was then accepted, retried or escalated: the round id, `implement` or `fix`, the `validate_mode` that ran, and the run's `seconds`. [`dev-start.md` § Store Validation Time](../workflows/dev-start.md#store-validation-time) is the one writer; it appends, replacing an entry with the same `round_id`. The lane rewrites its status file's validation line from it, and `oversee-report`'s Validation row reads it |
| `review_wave_done` | string[] | Wave mode only: reviewers whose report artifact validated (or who went unresponsive) in the current review cycle. Reset at each new cycle's first wave; the next wave launches the first budget-sized batch of `[AGENTS]` not listed here |
| `reviewer_slots_observed` | number | Effective wave size proven by the runtime when a persistent (unlimited-budget) launch hit the thread limit. While set, `review-pr.md` § 2 enters wave mode at this size even though `REVIEWER_SLOT_BUDGET` is `0` |
| `pre_delegate_sha` | string\|null | HEAD before delegation — scopes re-review diffs. review-pr § 2.2 sends it to a re-review re-entry as `Diff-range`, a boundary no reviewer can derive from its own delegation. review-pr-comments § 6.1 writes it before a fix set and sends it as the verification pass's `Diff-range` |
| `skip_qa` | boolean | Skip QA for re-cycle (cleared after routing) |
| `cycles` | number | General fix-round tally — `dev-fix.md` increments it on every fix round (review-pr § 4 and § 7, plus pre-loop review/submit rounds). It fills review-pr § 1.2's previous-cycle block and the session summaries; it decides no cap |
| `rereview_cycles` | number | § 4 → § 2 re-review cycles entered, counting entries already taken. `workflow-state set … rereview_panel` raises it in the same locked write it gates, so only that re-entry spends the budget `REVIEW_MAX_CYCLES` bounds — a § 7 QA re-check (`qa_recheck_panel`), a § 2 verification pass (`verification_panel`), and any fix round do not |
| `submit_cycles` | number | Submit-PR iteration count (created-issue re-submit loops) |
| `review_delegated_at` | number | Epoch seconds of last review delegation — the freshness boundary `review-pr.md` § 3 passes to `review-artifact-check` |
| `dev_delegated_at` | number | Epoch second of the round's delegation. [`../references/skill-rules.md` § Round Closure](../references/skill-rules.md#round-closure) owns its uses |
| `dev_round_id` | string | Unique per-delegation round token, minted by `workflow-state new-round-id [ISSUE] dev_round_id` immediately before each dev/QA delegation and embedded in it. It is the completion artifact's identity ([`dev-return.md`](dev-return.md)) and, on a fix round, the delegated-item record's ([`dev-round.md`](dev-round.md)) |
| `round_prunes` | object | Round id to `{action, used_pct, mark_pct, bytes}`, one entry per round `round-prune` recorded, which a usage, state, setting or disk-read refusal is not: `action` is `pruned`, `below-mark`, `failed`, `target-elsewhere` or `no-worktree`, `bytes` what the prune freed, 0 below the mark or with no worktree. `round-prune` is the one writer |
| `tier` | string | The cycle the item runs, `micro`, `small` or `standard`, as `item-tier` assigned it; `set` refuses any other value as `tier-value`. [`start-worktree.md`](../workflows/start-worktree.md) § 1 writes `standard` on every entry and [`small.md`](../workflows/small.md) § 1 then writes `small`, so the record follows the run that executes. `small` holds `REVIEW_MAX_CYCLES` and `REVIEW_MAX_EXTERNAL_ROUNDS` to the tier ceilings `workflow-state --help` lists, and refuses a `first_panel`, `rereview_panel` or `verification_panel` with no boolean `external` as `panel-external`, or of more than three reviewers, the external lane counted, as `panel-bound`. Absent, no tier bound applies |
| `first_panel` | object | `{agents: string[], reason, external?}` for review-pr § 2's first-cycle panel, recorded on a § 1 entry: the reviewers the diff and the issue's Done-when give something to read, or the caller's `agents` with reason `caller panel` |
| `recovery_round_id` | string | The round id `round-recover` minted when a stalled round had no report, or a report the disk contradicts. That round's own failed recovery is exhausted, never re-delegated again |
| `rereview_panel` | object | `{agents: string[], reason, external?}` for a § 4 fix round re-reviewed by a scoped panel instead of the full set. Setting it is the § 4 → § 2 re-review re-entry |
| `qa_recheck_panel` | object | `{agents: string[], reason}` for review-pr § 7's § 7 → § 6 QA re-check |
| `verification_panel` | object | `{agents: string[], reason, external?}` for a pass over a fix diff no reviewer has seen, which no cap gates: review-pr § 7's § 7 → § 2 pass, review-pr § 4's pass once the budget is spent, and review-pr-comments § 6.1's pass before the push |
| `json_paths` | string[] | Accumulated review JSON file paths. review-pr § 4 Bounded Re-Review reads the reviewers named in them as the domains already reviewed |
| `fixed_items` | object[] | Blockers successfully fixed. A `commit` of the form `dropped:<sha>` marks a fix whose commit vanished in a rebase (its patch was already upstream) — publishers omit it or cite the upstream equivalent, never print it as a live SHA |
| `escalated_items` | object[] | Items dev did not apply, plus items still outstanding when review-pr's cycle cap ends the fix loop. `outcome` records the per-item decision — `"blocked"` (could not fix; the cap path always writes this) or `"skipped"` (deliberately skipped); an entry without `outcome` is treated as blocked. The audit builder maps it to a distinct `origin`. An item is never in both buckets: every dev-fix outcome write clears the item from both, matched on (location, description), before appending its own entry |
| `declined_items` | object[] | Findings review-pr § 4 or § 7 declined, one `{description, location, reason, source}` per (location, description), a re-raised decline replacing its entry. The re-review and QA delegations list them as Declined, `review-artifact-check --issue` reports a finding at a listed location under `repeats` as a candidate carrying each decline recorded there, and § 8 carries each one's reason |
| `audit_issues_created` | string[] | Issue IDs created by audit |
| `rebase_map` | object | Old→new commit SHA map accumulated by orch `worktree-push` from the worktree-private `kendex-rebase-map` file, which is the only channel it reads: it holds what a completed guarded restack recorded before the push and what the push itself recorded during it. Keys are pre-rebase SHAs; values are post-rebase SHAs, or the literal `"dropped"` when the replayed commit vanished. `worktree-push` rewrites the SHAs stored elsewhere in state at push time — `fixed_items[].commit` and `pr_comment_review.fixes[].commit` become the new SHA truncated to the recorded length, or the marked form `dropped:<recorded sha>` for a dropped mapping. The map remains for artifact-sourced references (e.g. perf QA `benchmark_commit`) — resolve through it repeatedly until no key matches |
| `pr` | object | Pull-request size state. `size_check` initializes as null and holds the latest report from `branch-size-check` without `--cut-from-round`: `base_sha` and `head_sha`, the commits it compared; `production_lines`, `test_lines` and `mirror_lines`, the added lines in each part; `production_allowance` and `test_allowance` from the issue's optional `**Expected delta**` line, null where absent; the `verdict` (`pass`, `over`, `allowance_missing`) and its `reason`, which for `allowance_missing` names which of its two causes applied: an issue that was read and states no line, or a key such as `pr-N` or `local-` that names no issue to read. Cut acceptance uses the comparison in [dev-round.md § Declared cuts](dev-round.md#declared-cuts). Cut comparisons leave the record unchanged; other measurements overwrite it. A reader binds it to a head by `head_sha`; review-gate's `pr-watch.sh` annotates its `disarmed` line with the record for the PR head and reports any other as stale |
| `pr_review_baseline` | object | `last_threads[]` — the unresolved review-thread IDs present at the end of the last triage pass. `review-pr-comments.md` § 6.3 calls a thread new when its id is absent from this array; never store a count here |
| `pr_comment_review` | object | PR comment review tracking: `iterations`, `fixes[]`, `issues_created[]`, `skipped[]`, `replied[]` (thread IDs answered), `proposed_rules[]` (deduplicated rules accepted from dev artifact summaries for the PR body), `patched_causes[]` — one `{cause, commit}` per patched cause, the single record [finding-disposition.md § Recurrence](../references/finding-disposition.md#recurrence) reads: this workflow writes it where the reply resolves the thread, and [dev-fix.md](../workflows/dev-fix.md) § 2 writes it for the `pr-review`, `qa-review`, and `review` loops, whose items land in `fixed_items`; `frozen_causes[]` — one `{cause, issue}` per cause frozen by [finding-disposition.md § Recurrence](../references/finding-disposition.md#recurrence), written before the `Tracked:` reply; a later finding on a listed cause is declined, never re-triaged |
| `pr_approval` | object | Reviewer-gate override tracking: `forced` (the user chose Force merge to stop waiting for a missing verdict; item-wide, set only by `submit-pr.md` § 4's Force merge, never cleared by a push, and read by `submit-pr.md` § 6.1 gate 4 and `merge-pr.md` § 3.2 and § 5), `reviewer_down` (`PR_REVIEW_ON_TIMEOUT=proceed` auto-proceeded past the deadline with every reviewer silent) |
| `post_pr_budgets` | object | Automatic retry budgets owned by `workflow-state head-budget`: `review_wait` and `ci_fix` are null or `{head, attempts}`. `take` is the only action, and it spends an attempt atomically. It starts the count over on a changed authoritative head for `review_wait` only; `ci_fix` counts across heads, because every ci-fix cycle pushes one. A continuing action resets either field by clearing it with `workflow-state update` |
| `children_detached` | boolean | `true` once `submit-pr.md` § 2 step 5 ran `merge-pr.md` § 4.1's detach before its arm; § 4.1 then skips, so the detach runs once and before any arm |
| `post_pr_stop` | object\|null | A post-PR cap outcome written under `auto-recommended`: `{name, gate, remaining[]}`. The same stop is posted to the PR. A continuing action clears it |
| `pr_review` | object | Reviewer-gate mode tracking: `mode` ("approval"/"review"/"exempt"/"off" as printed by `approval-wait --resolve-mode`) and `head_sha`, the commit that mode was resolved for. A mode belongs to the endpoints it was resolved over, and the class is measured over both: a push moves the head, a retarget moves the base alone. The pair is a DIAGNOSTIC — it says what the last resolution saw — and no gate is decided from it. A reader that must waive resolves again at the live endpoints first, which is why this record has no base beside the head |
| `handoff` | object | The lane's hand-off record, written by `workflow-state set [ISSUE_ID] handoff` at the mark [oversee-events.md § Judgement rules](../references/oversee-events.md#judgement-rules) sets: the PRs `merged`, the steps `remaining`, the `branch`, the `worktree`, the `open_pr` number or null, and the `traps` the next session must know. `written_at` is the UTC time `set` stamps from its own clock when the record carries none; one later than that clock is refused as `handoff-written-at-future`, and the `set` entry in `workflow-state --help` names the rest of what it refuses there. `oversee-watch` reports it as `handoff` while `resumed_at` is absent; `start.md` § 0 stamps `resumed_at` when the relaunched lane resumes from it. On the fleet item the record is the overseer's own, written when its succession refuses, and it carries two more fields naming the session that wrote it: `session_id`, the id that session's Stop payload gave, and `pane_key`, its `<tmux server pid> <pane id>` for a harness whose payload names no session. The turn-end hook ends its refusal on a record whose names are its own and on no other, because every overseer of the fleet in turn shares this one item |

## Oversee state

`workflow-state-oversee.json`, under the key `oversee`, is the fleet's record, at the one address every launch passes `open-terminal --state-dir` and the watch reads as `--state` ([oversee.md § 3 Lane record](../workflows/oversee.md#3-launch)). `open-terminal` creates it on the first launch of a tmux fleet; the other surfaces create it as oversee.md § 3 Lane record directs. It carries the fields above unused and these:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `lanes` | object[] | One record per launched lane, written by `open-terminal` and read by `oversee-watch --state`: `{item, tracker, repo, harness, window, account, host, mail_root, surface, model, session_id, launched_at, running_at, status, over_cap}`, plus `prepare` on a hosted lane handed to a background job, `parked` on a lane `lane-close --park` parked and `cycle` on a lane whose PR merged. `item` is the lane's workflow-state key (the Linear id, or `issue-N` for a GitHub item) and the record's identity. `tracker`, `repo` and `harness` let `lane-close` check the live work item and stop the correct harness without caller-supplied identity; a record written before those three were recorded carries none of them, and `lane-close --tracker`, `--repo` and `--harness` supply what an idle lane's close-out needs, each filling only a field the record leaves null or absent. Two of those three `lane-close` reads for itself where the record and the options both leave them empty: `tracker` from a tracker-identifier item key, which is `linear`, and `harness` from the pane the record's `window` names, where that pane runs the harness rather than a wrapper with the harness under it. An `issue-N` key derives no tracker, being what a GitHub lane is keyed by and what a Linear lane is keyed by wherever `GH_ISSUE_PATTERN` accepts that spelling, so a record under that key carrying no `tracker` refuses as `tracker-read-failed cause=key-ambiguous` and takes `--tracker linear|github`, with `--repo` besides where that answer is `github`. `repo` is derived from nothing, so a GitHub lane whose record carries none still needs `--repo`. A derived value never beats a recorded or a supplied one, and where the item key does answer the tracker, `--tracker` only pins what the key already says. A launch appends a record where none names the item and rewrites every field where one does; a relaunch rewrites every field but `item`, `launched_at` and `over_cap`; a wake rewrites `session_id` and `status`, and is refused as `record-missing` where no record names the item, since that is a lane the launcher never launched. `window` is the tmux window in tmux's `SESSION:WINDOW` target form, the session being the one the launch opened it in, which `lane-close`, `lanes state`, `pane-write` and `oversee-watch` resolve under exactly that session. A hand-written record may carry a bare name: `lane-close`, `lanes state` and `pane-write` resolve it on any session of the server, and `oversee-watch` in its caller's own session only. Null off tmux. `account` is the lane's config dir, null with no `--lane`. `host` is the lane-host spec, null for a lane on this host. `mail_root` is the lane's worktree as its own host sees it, what `lane-mail --root` and `oversee-watch --hosted` take. `surface` is `tmux` or `gui`. `model` is the `--model` value in the launch flags, null when none. `session_id` is the harness session the lane resumed, null until a relaunch or wake. `launched_at` is the UTC launch time; the first record's is the fleet start `oversee-watch --since` takes. `running_at` is the UTC time a launch or relaunch recorded the lane `running`, null while it reads `preparing`, which a relaunch renews and a wake keeps; `oversee-watch` counts the `start-stalled` window from it, from `launched_at` on a record carrying none. `status` is `preparing` while a lane handed to a background job waits for its host, `running` while the lane is live, `stopped` after `lane-close --keep-sandbox` stops the harness and removes the window or after that job failed and closed its window, `parked` after `lane-close --park` ends a hosted lane's clean merge wait, its harness stopped, its window removed and its sandbox stopped with the disk kept, and `done` after full close-out. The watch carries `running` records, and `parked` ones for its merged check alone, whose `merged` of the pull request `parked` names, in that repository, closes the parked sandbox without waking it; `open-terminal` counts `running` and `preparing` records against `ORCH_OVERSEER_LANES`, so a parked lane holds no working-lane capacity, and its relaunch, which starts the sandbox first, is judged as adding a lane. `parked` is `{pr, head, repo, at}`, written by `lane-close --park` alone: the pull request and head the park judged, the repository it read them in, which the watch matches against its `--repo` set in lower case since GitHub reads owner and repository names case-insensitively, and the UTC time. A relaunch drops it and rewrites the record `stopped` once the provider confirms the sandbox's start and before its create, so a create that fails after the start leaves `stopped`, the sandbox up with no harness in it, which a plain relaunch recovers; a launch that records the lane `running` drops it as well. `prepare` is `{since, log, pid, reason}`: `since` is that launch's own `launched_at` stamp, read before the window opens, which a relaunch renews while the record's `launched_at` stays; `log` is the job's output file; `pid` is the job's process group, present while the record reads `preparing`, which `lane-close` stops; `reason`, on a failure only, is `wait-failed` for the host's preparation or `launch-failed` for a launch step. The status is the outcome: `preparing` is pending, `running` ready, and `stopped` with a `reason` failed. Any other launch or relaunch of the item drops the field. `oversee-watch` reports each outcome once per `since`, and a `preparing` record older than `ORCH_WATCH_PREPARE_SECS` once. `over_cap` is the caps an `open-terminal --over-cap` launch passed, `fleet`, `account` or `fleet,account`, and null for a launch inside both. `cycle` is `{pr, class, class_cause, tier, stamps, target, actual, verdict, phase, phase_secs, missing, rounds, escaped, refixed}`, written by `oversee-cycle record` alone and kept by every later launch, relaunch or wake: `stamps` is `{launched, first_commit, pr_opened, gate_green, ci_green, armed, merged}`, `rounds` is `{review, fix, bot, full_validations}` or null where the lane's state was gone, and `oversee-cycle --help` owns every field's meaning and the per-class targets |
| `tmux` | object | `{session}`: the tmux session every lane window of the fleet opens in, written by the fleet's first `open-terminal` tmux launch once tmux confirms that session exists, and read by every later one where `ORCH_TMUX_SESSION` names none (`open-terminal --help` § `--tmux`). A launch with `ORCH_TMUX_SESSION` set needs no `$TMUX`: it reaches that session on the person's own tmux server, the socket tmux derives from their uid (`scripts/lib/tmux-server.sh`) |
| `overseer` | object | The overseer session itself, the session record [overseer-host.md](overseer-host.md) § The session record names: `{runtime, generation, server, pane, window, session_rows, exit, harness, account, home, model, effort, cwd, launch_line, pending}`. `runtime` is the value `overseer-host resolve` answered when the session was opened, `tmux` today, and a session never changes runtime. `generation` counts the sessions recorded on this fleet: `oversee launch` and `oversee-succeed` write one more than the record they replace, before the new session's first turn, and put the prior record back when the launch is abandoned; `oversee register` writes the next generation for a session a person opened by hand, keeps it where the record already names that pane, and drops the prior `launch_line`, since nothing knows the line a hand-opened session was started with. `server` and `pane` are the `<tmux server pid> <pane id>` key `lib/lane-context.sh` builds a session's own row on, which the turn-end hook compares its own against; `window` is the pane's window; `session_rows` is the file that pane's own harness writes its SessionStart, SessionEnd and usage-limit StopFailure rows to, `tmp/lane-mail/overseer/session-<server>-<pane number>.jsonl` at the main checkout, named by `scripts/lib/session-rows.sh` and written by every writer of `server` and `pane`; `oversee-watch` judges the overseer's death and wall from it, and `oversee register` and `oversee-succeed` read the session's identity from its SessionStart row, each taking the pane as the named fallback where no row answers; `exit` is `{status, at}`, the harness's exit status and UTC time, written by `scripts/overseer-run`, which every launch line runs under, once that line returns and only where the record names its pane, and dropped by it before the line runs, and dropped by every later record write and watch start, and `oversee-watch` reads it as the session's death ahead of its rows where the pane's process is a bare shell with nothing under it; `harness`, `account`, `home`, `model`, `effort` and `cwd` are the session's launch identity, written by the one record writer `lib/overseer-launch.sh` holds from the command its builder made, each null where the launch did not know it: `harness` is `claude`, `codex`, `copilot` or `pi`, `account` the account folder the session spends, null where none was picked, as for a `pi` session on a provider no lane measures, `home` the directory its account variable carries, which for codex is the private `CODEX_HOME` a folder-trust launch builds under the account and otherwise the account itself, `model` and `effort` the words its launch flags name, and `cwd` the directory it started in. `oversee register` records the model its SessionStart row names, none without one, and no effort. A `--dead-pane` relaunch builds no command, so it writes the identity the record held for the line it replays: the `pending` member's where that is the line, the current session's where `launch_line` is, and null where the record held neither. `oversee-succeed` reads this identity for the session the record names, by `server` and `pane`, ahead of that session's SessionStart row, then `--harness`, that pane's command, its context reading and its account variables, which answer only for a session nothing has recorded and for a field left null. Its `--check-marks` judgement takes the harness, account and model from here, and the context mark still rests on the `--context` reading. Its succession and the `--print-launch-line` the watch records at startup take the harness, account and directory from here, and take `model` and `effort` as one pair, only where `model` is set: that pair then replaces the one the caller's flags spell, and with no `model` the flags keep theirs. The printed line so names the account the session was opened on even where its environment names none, as a session launched from a stored token has none. `launch_line` is the whole successor command: lane prefix, harness, current model, effort, permission flags and brief. `pending` is the successor a succession is about to open, `{launch_line, harness, account, home, model, effort, cwd}`, which `oversee-succeed` and `oversee launch --predecessor` write before that launch's window opens and never reads as the current session's identity, so a pending command cannot move the account or model the running overseer is judged on; the record the successor's launch writes drops it, and an abandoned launch puts back the record it read before. Each live `oversee-watch` invocation replaces `server`, `pane`, `window`, `session_rows` and `launch_line` once at startup through `oversee-succeed --print-launch-line`, including after a manual restart in the same pane and after the restart `oversee-succeed` makes from a successor's pane, so `pane` names the pane the running watch serves; it keeps `runtime`, `generation` and the launch identity where the record names its own pane on its own server and drops them where it names another session's, and drops `pending` either way. A start that cannot build or write the record leaves it as it stood and says so as `overseer-line-missing` or `overseer-unrecorded`, on stderr and in the fleet log, and watches the session all the same, from the `exit` and `session_rows` the record already holds for this pane, or from the pane, the named fallback, where it names neither. Watch recording always receives the current model and effort, even when `ORCH_OVERSEER_PREFERENCE` is set: the record's pair where it names a model, the watch's flags otherwise. Live self-succession uses that preference instead. `oversee-watch` hands the last live-owned line back through a file on `overseer-dead`, a standing `pending.launch_line` ahead of `launch_line`, which covers the interval before a successor starts its watch, and only where the record names the dead pane on its server: after a start whose record failed, that line is the last one a launch, a succession or a watch start recorded for that pane, which a session restarted by hand may not have been started with, and a record naming another pane is reported as a death with no successor, the event and notice naming that record ([oversee-events.md § Event kinds](../references/oversee-events.md#event-kinds)) |
| `triaged` | object[] | The verdict log: `{issue, verdict, reason}` per issue the triage verifier judged, `verdict` `kept` or `canceled`, appended by [oversee-events.md § Event kinds](../references/oversee-events.md#event-kinds) `heartbeat`; the watch rebuilds its acknowledged triage keys from it |
| `fleet_log` | object[] | The fleet log: `{at, kind, item, text}` per ruling, appended as [oversee-events.md § Judgement rules](../references/oversee-events.md#judgement-rules) directs. `at` is the UTC time `append-file` stamps from its own clock when the record carries none, one later than that clock being refused as `fleet-log-at-future` and the `append-file` entry in `workflow-state --help` naming the rest of what it refuses there, `kind` one of `proposal`, `ruling`, `close`, `peer` or `cycle`, the last written by `oversee-cycle` alone, `item` the issue or repository the entry is about, or the class a `cycle` rollup row sums, `text` the ruling or outcome in one line. Its byte cap and its readers are [§ Recording policy](#recording-policy) |
| `launch_queue` | string[] | The items the overseer's last selection chose and has not launched, in launch order, rewritten at each selection. It holds the order and never the membership: `oversee-watch` names each tracker item the fleet owes that it lacks as an `owed` line under every heartbeat (`oversee-watch --help`). `oversee-report` renders its head as the status report's Next row, less any item with a `lanes[]` record of any status, since a record is written at launch. The report's Waiting on you row is not state: it is the unresolved owner asks in the overseer mailbox (`lane-mail --help` § Owner channel), and the newest owner progress report, § Recording policy below, is the last report (`oversee-report --help`) |

## Recording policy

Eight durable records outlive a turn on the control host. Each has one reader, one shape and one retention, and `workflow-state prune` enforces the retention. Every setting below resolves through `orch-env` on the kendex settings ladder: process environment, then `.env.local`, then `.kendex/settings.toml` or `kendex.settings.toml` `[env]`, then the default.

| Setting | Meaning | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `ORCH_FLEET_LOG_ROW_BYTES` | Most bytes one fleet log row's `text` may carry | `600` |
| `ORCH_TAKEOVER_ROWS` | Fleet log rows a successor overseer reads at takeover | `10` |
| `ORCH_RECORD_RETENTION_DAYS` | Days past the stamp each record's Retention cell names before `prune` archives and removes it: the newest write inside a path, a fleet log row's `at`, a lane record's `launched_at` | `14` |
| `ORCH_PROGRESS_REPORT_DIR` | Owner progress report directory; a relative path joins the main checkout | `tmp/progress-reports` |

| Record | Reader | Shape | Retention |
|--------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Fleet log rows, `fleet_log[]` above | The successor overseer at takeover reads the last `ORCH_TAKEOVER_ROWS` rows other than `cycle` rows through `workflow-state fleet-log takeover`, which prints nothing on a first session with no fleet state yet. Audits read the `proposal` and `ruling` rows through `workflow-state fleet-log audit` | `at` stamped by `append-file`, `kind`, `item`, and one line of `text` of at most `ORCH_FLEET_LOG_ROW_BYTES` bytes. `append-file` refuses a longer row as `fleet-log-row-bytes` | A row whose `at` is past the retention is pruned. A row with no ISO 8601 UTC `at` is kept |
| Overseer handoff file, `handoffs/OVERSEER-HANDOFF.md` | The successor overseer, at [oversee.md § 1](../workflows/oversee.md#1-resolve-the-launch-surface) | [communication-modes.md § Handoff](../references/communication-modes.md#handoff) | The file itself is kept. Other files under `handoffs/` are pruned past the retention of their newest write, unless [§ Prune](#prune)'s keep list holds them |
| Lane records, `lanes[]` above | `oversee-watch`, `lane-close` and the overseer. A lane's timing stamps live in this record and nowhere else, so any rollup of them reads this record | The `lanes` row above | A `done` record whose `launched_at` is past the retention is pruned. The first record is kept whatever its age or status, since its `launched_at` is the fleet start `oversee-watch --since` takes |
| Lane status file, `tmp/lane-status-[ISSUE_ID].md` | The overseer, through [oversee.md § Bounded lane reads](../workflows/oversee.md#bounded-lane-reads), and `oversee-watch`, which reads only whether it exists, for `start-stalled` | [oversee.md § 3 Lane directive](../workflows/oversee.md#lane-directive), at most 40 non-empty lines | Under the lane's `mail_root`. It leaves with the lane's worktree when that is removed, after [§ Item close-out](#item-close-out) archives the worktree's `tmp/` at the merge; `lane-host close` archives a hosted lane's `tmp` records and prints `kept=PATH`. `prune` reaches one only for an item that ran in the main checkout, and removes it past the retention of its newest write, unless [§ Prune](#prune)'s keep list holds it |
| Lane mailbox, `tmp/lane-mail/[ISSUE_ID]/` | The lane and the overseer, through `lane-mail` | `lane-mail --help` § Envelope | Same as the lane status file |
| Context reading, `context.json` in a lane's mailbox and in the overseer mailbox `tmp/lane-mail/overseer/` | A lane's: `lanes context`. The overseer's: `oversee-succeed`, for its harness and model alone, since the overseer is judged on the `--context` reading its own turn-end hook passes. The `lane-mail-check` turn-end hook writes it at every turn end it reads a transcript at | `lane_context_record` in `scripts/lib/lane-context.sh` | A lane's follows its lane mailbox. A local relaunch keeps the reading only when its session identity matches the selected resumed session. A fresh or different local session clears it. A hosted launch clears it. The overseer's is rewritten at each turn end the hook records one at, Pi's included; a `transcript-unowned` one leaves the stored reading, a same-pane predecessor's included, or none. Never removed or pruned |
| Pi lane session rows, `session-rows.jsonl` in a Pi lane's mailbox | `oversee-watch` and `lanes state`, which judge a Pi lane idle, working or walled from its last row in place of its pane. The `lane-mail-check` hook writes a Stop row at each turn end and a PreToolUse row at the first tool call of each turn, after a turn end or on an empty file | `session_rows_lane_write` in `scripts/lib/session-rows.sh`, one JSON row per line | Follows its lane mailbox. Never removed or pruned |
| Owner progress report, `MM-DD-HH-MM.md` under `ORCH_PROGRESS_REPORT_DIR` | The owner, and `oversee-report`, which reads each report's name and modification time and none of its content: the newest is the last report its cadence and Landed row count from (`oversee-report --help`) | [communication-modes.md § Status report](../references/communication-modes.md#status-report). Each decision names the paths it chose between and the outcome of each path | Pruned past the retention, and counted as `progress_reports=N` |

The overseer writes one progress report beside each status report it gives in chat, and one at every succession, named `MM-DD-HH-MM-succession.md`. The time in the name is UTC. `workflow-state progress-report-path [--succession]` prints the path and creates the directory. The default directory is under `tmp/`, which the repository's `# kendex:local-state` ignore block covers, so no commit picks a report up.

### Prune

`workflow-state prune [--keep PATH]...` works on the fleet state `workflow-state-oversee.json` and the directory that holds it, by default `tmp/` in the main checkout. A progress report directory that is or holds that directory refuses as `prune-progress-overlap`. The overseer runs it at every succession and once at fleet close, as [oversee.md § 5](../workflows/oversee.md#5-stop) directs. A checkout with no fleet state, where no overseer runs, takes the same pass at each item's close-out, which `remove` below runs: there it has no lane records to judge, so it prunes nothing from a state. A state directory that is not there prints the zero count and `kept=none`.

The keep list holds whatever the age:

- `workflow-state-oversee.json` and its lock, and the watch's own files beside it that `scripts/lib/watch-pid.sh` names: `oversee-watch.pid`, `.argv`, the `.log` and `.err` a succession-restarted watch writes, and the `.runner` record of how the succession started it.
- `handoffs/OVERSEER-HANDOFF.md`, the `handoffs/` and progress report directories themselves, and the overseer's own mailbox `lane-mail/overseer/`.
- Each `--keep PATH`, and each path that holds it. The overseer names the current watch run directory here.
- Every path of that directory whose name carries, as a whole token, the item of a lane whose record is not `done`: a `running` lane, and a `preparing` or `stopped` lane a relaunch resumes.
- Every path of that directory whose name carries, as a whole token, the item of a workflow state that stands there, with or without a fleet state, while that state was written within `ORCH_RECORD_RETENTION_DAYS` or it names a linked worktree that still exists, never the main checkout: its `worktree` field where that is one, else the one with its `branch` checked out, as `git-context lane-worktree` resolves it for `round-prune` too. The item's close-out takes that state when the item ends, and a lane closed while its item was open leaves it for a later resume. A state past the retention that names no such worktree belongs to an item no close-out reached and nothing resumes, and it goes with its files like any other entry.

Every other entry of that directory, whatever wrote it, every entry under its `handoffs/` and `lane-mail/`, and every `MM-DD-HH-MM.md` or `MM-DD-HH-MM-succession.md` in the progress report directory is a candidate when nothing inside it was written within `ORCH_RECORD_RETENTION_DAYS`: the overseer's waiter run directories, say, or a scratch directory such as `mutstab-diag/` that no script names. Before it removes anything, the prune writes one archive holding each candidate path and the pruned `fleet_log` rows and lane records, at `FLEET_DIR/archive/[REPO]/oversee/prune-[EPOCH]-[RANDOM].tgz`. `FLEET_DIR` defaults to `~/.fleet`, the root `lane-host close` also archives under, and `[REPO]` is the main checkout's directory name. The directory is `0700` and the archive `0600`. An archive it cannot build refuses as `prune-archive-failed` and removes nothing. It then drops the rows from the state and removes the paths. It prints `pruned path=PATH` per path, then `pruned fleet_log=N lanes=N progress_reports=N paths=N`, then `kept=ARCHIVE`, or `kept=none` where nothing was archived.

### Item close-out

`workflow-state remove ITEM` is the one owner of what an item leaves in that directory once it ends. It removes every entry the prune would judge whose name carries the item as a whole token, whatever its age. In a lane that runs in its own worktree that is the item's workflow state and its lock, which the lane writes under the main checkout, and any file under `handoffs/` named for it; the lane's `completion-summary-ITEM.md`, `dev-return-ITEM-RID.json` and the rest land under the worktree's own `tmp/` and go with the worktree. Only an item that ran in the main checkout leaves those beside its state, and there `remove` takes them too. The lane status file and the lane mailbox stay for their retention above, as do the keep list's named files.

Before it removes anything, `remove` writes one archive through the prune's own archive writer, at `FLEET_DIR/archive/[REPO]/oversee/close-[ITEM]-[EPOCH]-[RANDOM].tgz` on the host it runs on, private and relative to `/` as [§ Prune](#prune) describes. The archive holds every path it is about to remove, the item's lane status file and lane mailbox beside them, and each `--archive PATH` that exists. `--archive` names a path the caller removes after the close-out: [merge-pr.md § 5](../workflows/merge-pr.md#5-execute-the-merge) step 6 names the worktree's `tmp/`, which holds the item's round artifacts, review artifacts, validation run directories and lane mailbox. The archive keeps each file's bytes and modification time as written. An archive it cannot build refuses as `remove-archive-failed` and removes nothing. With nothing to remove and no `--archive` path standing, it writes no archive. It prints `removed path=PATH` per path, then `removed kept=ARCHIVE`, or `removed kept=none` where it wrote no archive. A path it cannot remove refuses as `remove-failed`, naming it and the archive that holds it. Where no fleet state stands, it then runs the prune and prints the prune's lines after its own. A lane's own run calls it at [merge-pr.md § 5](../workflows/merge-pr.md#5-execute-the-merge) step 6, and `lane-close` calls it on the fleet's state directory at a full close of an item its tracker answers finished; a `--keep-sandbox` close, or one of an item still open, keeps the files a relaunch resumes into. A file with no item in its name is left to the prune's age.

The watch log is rotated, not pruned. Each watch launch writes into a fresh run directory ([waiter-launch.md § Launch](../references/waiter-launch.md#launch)), so a successor's watch appends to a new log, and the prior run directory leaves the keep list and ages out under the same retention. A succession-restarted watch writes `oversee-watch.log` and `.err` beside the fleet state instead, which the keep list holds with the pid and argv files until the next watch start prints and removes them.

## CLI

All operations use `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state` (run with `help` for full usage).

To target a state directory from a worktree, pass the global `--state-dir <path>` flag before the subcommand — it takes precedence over `ORCH_STATE_DIR`. Prefer it over an `ORCH_STATE_DIR=… workflow-state …` env prefix, which orch's shell rule does not take ([../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § Harness-Safe Shell). `ORCH_STATE_DIR` stays supported as an environment fallback.

`set` values are JSON only when they look like it — a `{`/`[` prefix, exactly `null`/`true`/`false`, or all digits. `append` is narrower: only a `{`/`[` prefix is spliced as JSON (a bare `null`/`true`/`123` appends as a string). Every other value is stored as a raw string: pass plain strings bare — `set PROJ-123 pr_review.mode review`, never `'"review"'`. `update` always takes a jq expression.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state init PROJ-123 --agent backend --worktree /tmp/wt
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state head-budget take PROJ-123 review-wait abcdef01
