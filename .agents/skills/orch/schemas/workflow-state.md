# Workflow State Schema

Persistent state file for orch workflows. Survives context compaction.

**Location**: `<state-dir>/workflow-state-[ISSUE_ID].json` — `<state-dir>` resolves to the global `--state-dir <path>` flag, then `$ORCH_STATE_DIR`, then `tmp/`.

**Key**: `[ISSUE_ID]` is the normalized workflow-state key — `issue-N` for GitHub issues, `PROJ-123` for Linear — never the bare GitHub issue number. Every `workflow-state` action, `init` included, uses the key exactly as given, so the spelling passed to `init` is the spelling every later command must use.

## Field Definitions

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `issue_id` | string | Parent issue identifier |
| `sub_issues` | string[] | Child issue IDs if bundled |
| `agent` | string | Primary dev agent type |
| `worktree` | string | Absolute path to git worktree |
| `branch` | string | Git branch name |
| `qa_labels` | string[] | QA trigger labels from dev return |
| `child_sessions` | object | Per-agent lifecycle keyed by logical agent name: `{agent: {status, agent_id, runtime_agent_type, agent_type_fallback, spawned_at}}`. `status` is `"active"` while the session is live (`dev-start.md` § 2 stamps it at spawn) and `"closed"` once the caller's shutdown step retires it (`start-worktree.md` § 5.5). Reviewer slot accounting treats a record with a missing `status` field as active |
| `review_agents` | string[] | Reviewer names currently expected to stay alive across fix/re-review cycles; in wave mode (`REVIEWER_SLOT_BUDGET` exceeded) only the currently launched wave |
| `review_agent_ids` | object | Reviewer session IDs keyed by name — reuse before spawning `{"name":"id",...}` |
| `review_agent_runtime_types` | object | Reviewer runtime agent metadata keyed by logical reviewer name: `{name: {agent_type, task_name?, fallback}}`; records a Codex `worker` fallback and, when the runtime `task_name` schema forced a hyphens-to-underscores spelling, the translated `task_name` — without changing the logical keys |
| `review_wave_done` | string[] | Wave mode only: reviewers whose report artifact validated (or who went unresponsive) in the current review cycle. Reset at each new cycle's first wave; the next wave launches the first budget-sized batch of `[AGENTS]` not listed here |
| `reviewer_slots_observed` | number | Effective wave size proven by the runtime when a persistent (unlimited-budget) launch hit the thread limit. While set, `review-pr.md` § 2 enters wave mode at this size even though `REVIEWER_SLOT_BUDGET` is `0` |
| `pre_delegate_sha` | string\|null | HEAD before delegation — scopes re-review diffs. review-pr § 2.2 sends it to a re-review re-entry as `Diff-range`, a boundary no reviewer can derive from its own delegation |
| `skip_qa` | boolean | Skip QA for re-cycle (cleared after routing) |
| `cycles` | number | General fix-round tally — `dev-fix.md` increments it on every fix round (review-pr § 4 and § 7, plus pre-loop review/submit rounds). It fills review-pr § 1.2's previous-cycle block and the session summaries; it decides no cap |
| `rereview_cycles` | number | § 4 → § 2 re-review cycles entered, counting entries already taken. `workflow-state set … rereview_panel` raises it in the same locked write it gates, so only that re-entry spends the budget `REVIEW_MAX_CYCLES` bounds — a § 7 QA re-check (`qa_recheck_panel`), a § 2 verification pass (`verification_panel`), and any fix round do not |
| `submit_cycles` | number | Submit-PR iteration count (created-issue re-submit loops) |
| `review_delegated_at` | number | Epoch seconds of last review delegation — the freshness boundary `review-pr.md` § 3 passes to `review-artifact-check` |
| `dev_delegated_at` | number | Epoch seconds of last dev/QA delegation — the watchdog deadline for stall escalation. It does not gate artifact acceptance; the round id does |
| `dev_round_id` | string | Unique per-delegation round token, minted by `workflow-state new-round-id [ISSUE] dev_round_id` immediately before each dev/QA delegation and embedded in it. It is the completion artifact's identity ([`dev-return.md`](dev-return.md)) and, on a fix round, the delegated-item record's ([`dev-round.md`](dev-round.md)) |
| `rereview_panel` | object | `{agents: string[], reason}` for a § 4 fix round re-reviewed by a scoped panel instead of the full set. Setting it is the § 4 → § 2 re-review re-entry |
| `qa_recheck_panel` | object | `{agents: string[], reason}` for review-pr § 7's § 7 → § 6 QA re-check |
| `verification_panel` | object | `{agents: string[], reason}` for review-pr § 7's § 7 → § 2 pass over a fix diff no reviewer has seen |
| `json_paths` | string[] | Accumulated review JSON file paths |
| `fixed_items` | object[] | Blockers successfully fixed. A `commit` of the form `dropped:<sha>` marks a fix whose commit vanished in a rebase (its patch was already upstream) — publishers omit it or cite the upstream equivalent, never print it as a live SHA |
| `escalated_items` | object[] | Items dev did not apply, plus items still outstanding when review-pr's cycle cap ends the fix loop. `outcome` records the per-item decision — `"blocked"` (could not fix; the cap path always writes this) or `"skipped"` (deliberately skipped); an entry without `outcome` is treated as blocked. The audit builder maps it to a distinct `origin`. An item is never in both buckets: every dev-fix outcome write clears the item from both, matched on (location, description), before appending its own entry |
| `audit_issues_created` | string[] | Issue IDs created by audit |
| `rebase_map` | object | Old→new commit SHA map accumulated from `worktree push` auto-rebase output (`rebase-map:` lines), written by orch `worktree-push`. Keys are pre-rebase SHAs; values are post-rebase SHAs, or the literal `"dropped"` when the replayed commit vanished. `worktree-push` rewrites the SHAs stored elsewhere in state at push time — `fixed_items[].commit` and `pr_comment_review.fixes[].commit` become the new SHA truncated to the recorded length, or the marked form `dropped:<recorded sha>` for a dropped mapping. The map remains for artifact-sourced references (e.g. perf QA `benchmark_commit`) — resolve through it repeatedly until no key matches |
| `pr` | object | Pull-request growth state. `baseline_lines` is the one authoritative value. Accepted round-mode implementation receipts write it only when null; fix rounds only read it. Rebases and later rounds do not move it. `size_check` is the submit-time verdict `branch-size-check` records beside it: `base_sha` and `head_sha`, the commits it compared; `production_lines`, `test_lines` and `mirror_lines`, the added lines in each part; `production_allowance` and `test_allowance` as the issue's `**Expected delta**` line states them, null where it states none; the `verdict` (`pass`, `production_over`, `tests_over`, `allowance_missing`) and its `reason`. Every run overwrites the record: it reports the branch as it stands, never a history, and a reader binds it to a head by `head_sha` — review-gate's `pr-watch.sh` is one, annotating its `disarmed` line with the record whose `head_sha` is the PR's head, and reporting any other as stale |
| `pr_review_baseline` | object | `last_threads[]` — the unresolved review-thread IDs present at the end of the last triage pass. `review-pr-comments.md` § 6.3 calls a thread new when its id is absent from this array; never store a count here |
| `pr_comment_review` | object | PR comment review tracking: `iterations`, `fixes[]`, `issues_created[]`, `skipped[]`, `replied[]` (thread IDs answered), `patched_causes[]` — one `{cause, commit}` per patched cause, the single record [finding-disposition.md § Recurrence](../references/finding-disposition.md#recurrence) reads: this workflow writes it where the reply resolves the thread, and [dev-fix.md](../workflows/dev-fix.md) § 2 writes it for the `pr-review`, `qa-review`, and `review` loops, whose items land in `fixed_items`; `frozen_causes[]` — one `{cause, issue}` per cause frozen by [finding-disposition.md § Recurrence](../references/finding-disposition.md#recurrence), written before the `Tracked:` reply; a later finding on a listed cause is declined, never re-triaged |
| `pr_approval` | object | Reviewer-gate override tracking: `forced` (the user chose Force merge past a missing verdict), `reviewer_down` (`PR_REVIEW_ON_TIMEOUT=proceed` auto-proceeded past the deadline with every reviewer silent) |
| `post_pr_budgets` | object | Automatic retry budgets owned by `workflow-state head-budget`: `review_wait` and `ci_fix` are null or `{head, attempts}`. `take` is the only action, and it spends an attempt atomically. It starts the count over on a changed authoritative head for `review_wait` only; `ci_fix` counts across heads, because every ci-fix cycle pushes one. A continuing action resets either field by clearing it with `workflow-state update` |
| `post_pr_stop` | object\|null | A post-PR cap outcome written under `auto-recommended`: `{name, gate, remaining[]}`. The same stop is posted to the PR. A continuing action clears it |
| `pr_review` | object | Reviewer-gate mode tracking: `mode` ("approval"/"review"/"off" as printed by `approval-wait --resolve-mode`) |

## CLI

All operations use `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state` (run with `help` for full usage).

To target a state directory from a worktree, pass the global `--state-dir <path>` flag before the subcommand — it takes precedence over `ORCH_STATE_DIR`. Prefer it over an `ORCH_STATE_DIR=… workflow-state …` env prefix (rejected under Codex `approval=never`). `ORCH_STATE_DIR` stays supported as an environment fallback.

`set` values are JSON only when they look like it — a `{`/`[` prefix, exactly `null`/`true`/`false`, or all digits. `append` is narrower: only a `{`/`[` prefix is spliced as JSON (a bare `null`/`true`/`123` appends as a string). Every other value is stored as a raw string: pass plain strings bare — `set PROJ-123 pr_review.mode review`, never `'"review"'`. `update` always takes a jq expression.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state init PROJ-123 --agent backend --worktree /tmp/wt
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state head-budget take PROJ-123 review-wait abcdef01
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state update PROJ-123 '.post_pr_stop = null'
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get PROJ-123 .cycles
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get PROJ-123 .rereview_cycles
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state increment PROJ-123 cycles
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state append PROJ-123 json_paths "review.json"
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state set PROJ-123 pr_review.mode review
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state set PROJ-123 pr_review_baseline '{"last_threads":["PRRT_kwDOABC123","PRRT_kwDODEF456"]}'
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state --state-dir /path/to/tmp append PROJ-123 fixed_items '{"description":"Fix"}'
```
