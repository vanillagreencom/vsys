# Micro Workflow

The tier for an item whose whole change is a few lines. One agent reads the item, edits, commits, pushes, opens the pull request and waits the merge out: no dev subagent, no review cycle, no QA cycle, and no full validation battery. [oversee.md](oversee.md) § Item Tier picks the tier; every other item runs [start.md](start.md).

| Command | Flow |
|---------|------|
| `micro [ISSUE_ID]` | § 1 → § 5 |
| `micro github OWNER/REPO#N` | normalize to `ISSUE_ID=issue-N`, then § 1 → § 5 |

The runner is a lane in the item's worktree, or the overseer in the main checkout with no worktree for the item. `[WT_PATH]` is that checkout's root throughout. Steps marked **Main checkout only** are the second route's alone.

**Main checkout only.** The run returns that checkout to `[BASE_BRANCH]` before it reports anything: at § 3, at an escape, and at any stop in between. The supported transfer in § Escape moves the item's branch and any uncommitted edit into its worktree first. The fleet runs `sync-base`, `post-merge` and [consumer-train.md](consumer-train.md) in that checkout at every merge ([oversee-events.md § Event kinds](../references/oversee-events.md#event-kinds)), and `sync-base` refuses a tracked-dirty tree. § 5 reports the branch the checkout ends on.

## Budget

§ 1 through § 3 take about 8 minutes in a lane and about 3 in the overseer's own session. A run past that target finishes and reports the overrun in § 5.

## 1. Open The Session

Resolve `TRACKER` and `ISSUE_REF` from `[ISSUE_ID]` per [SKILL.md § Tracker Resolution](../SKILL.md#tracker-resolution), then the main checkout:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/git-context common-root .
```

Its output is `[MAIN_REPO_ROOT]`. Read the item. Linear:

```bash
.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh sync --reconcile
.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh cache issues get [ISSUE_ID] --with-bundle
```

```bash
.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh issues activate [ISSUE_ID]
```

GitHub:

```bash
gh issue view [N] --repo [OWNER/REPO] --json number,title,body,labels,url
```

A container, a blocked child, or a bundle escapes here (§ Escape condition 1).

**Main checkout only.** Sync the base, whose name the command prints as `[BASE_BRANCH]`, then cut the normalized issue branch as `[BRANCH]`, the lowercased issue id. That spelling is what the ownership scan in `worktree create` matches, so a later run reads the branch as owning the item:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/sync-base [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]
```

```bash
git -C [MAIN_REPO_ROOT] checkout -b [BRANCH]
```

In a lane worktree the branch already exists: gate on base freshness through [start-worktree.md](start-worktree.md) § 1 step 5 instead, and stop on its failure.

Read the branch both routes now stand on and initialize the item's workflow state with it. Its output binds `[BRANCH]` on the lane route, where nothing has named the branch yet, and confirms it on the other. `[BRANCH]` is the only name this workflow gives that branch, including § 4's `[PR_BRANCH]`:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/git-context branch [WT_PATH]
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state init [ISSUE_ID] --worktree [WT_PATH] --branch "[BRANCH_FROM_PREVIOUS_COMMAND]"
```

## 2. Edit And Commit

1. **Confirm the commit chain is armed**, before any file changes. That chain is this tier's whole validation: the diff-scoped guard rather than `DEV_VALIDATE_CMD`. An unarmed or unreadable answer escapes (§ Escape condition 2). Where the `commit-guards` package is installed this verb answers it and this workflow asks no other; elsewhere the project's own setup instructions name the verb.

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/commit-guards/scripts/install-git-hooks --check --repo [WT_PATH]
   ```

2. **Make the edit** the item's Done-when states. Nothing else enters the diff.

3. **Read the changed paths against § Escape condition 3**:

   ```bash
   git -C [WT_PATH] status --porcelain
   ```

   Every path that listing names is in scope, tracked change and untracked addition alike. Commit a path the edit did not make elsewhere, or remove it, before step 4. If a path is in condition 3's class, record escape condition 3 but continue through step 4. A successful commit then escapes. This ordering leaves a local commit that the standard workflow can continue.

4. **Commit the paths by name**, never `-A`, so the committed set is the one step 3 read. `[PREFIX]` is the Conventional Commits type the change is; the commit-msg hook judges it and the header's length. The repository's changelog rule applies as to any commit, and a refusal from the chain is its answer.

   ```bash
   git -C [WT_PATH] add [PATH]...
   ```

   ```bash
   git -C [WT_PATH] commit -m "[PREFIX]([ISSUE_ID]): [DESCRIPTION]"
   ```

   A successful commit with escape condition 3 recorded escapes now. Any other successful commit continues to § 3. A repository-rule refusal escapes as condition 4 with the staged edit still present; § Escape transfers that exact state.

## 3. Push And Open The PR

**Run Workflow**: `⤵ workflows/submit-pr.md § 2 steps 1-4 → § 3 tail` with context `worktree`, `lifecycle: "managed"`, `issue_id`. That range owns the push and its `sha-reconcile:` routing, the size measurement against the `**Expected delta**` line the tier was selected from, and the create. This tier changes two things inside it:

- The body is the three lines below rather than step 3's template. No headings and no other section.
- Step 1's measured verdict routes here: `over` escapes (§ Escape condition 5); `pass` and `allowance_missing` continue.

```markdown
[What the change does, in one sentence.]
[What checked it, in one sentence.]
Closes [ISSUE_REF]
```

`[ISSUE_TITLE]` for the create comes from the § 1 read. **Main checkout only**, return to the base branch now that the pull request holds the work:

```bash
git -C [MAIN_REPO_ROOT] checkout [BASE_BRANCH]
```

## 4. Arm And Wait

Bind what [merge-pr.md](merge-pr.md) § 1 binds once per run, which its §§ 4-7 consume and this entry skips. `[MAIN_REPO_ROOT]` is § 1's here, `merge_mode` stays `normal`, and `[ALREADY_MERGED]` is unset. The directory is where every stop in that range renders its comment:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/orch-env ORCH_DECISION_MODE auto-recommended
```

```bash
mkdir -p [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/tmp
```

Resolve the project's reviewer-gate mode, which merge-pr.md § 3 would have resolved ([references/gates.md](../references/gates.md)). Only `approval` can supply GitHub's required-review decision. `off` and `review` escape (§ Escape condition 7):

```bash
env -u GH_REPO -u GITHUB_REPOSITORY .agents/skills/orch/scripts/approval-wait --resolve-mode
```

Ask the canonical merge gate for its readiness object before any merge attempt:

```bash
env -u GH_REPO -u GITHUB_REPOSITORY [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh -C [MAIN_REPO_ROOT] pr-merge [PR_NUMBER] --check
```

Its JSON stdout is `[CHECK]`. Require a valid readiness object for an open pull request with no `review_fetch_failed:` issue. That issue means the review-status read was unavailable, whatever value `.review` carries. Read `.review` once as `[MICRO_REVIEW_STATE]` and route it by this table:

| `[MICRO_REVIEW_STATE]` | Route |
|------------------------|-------|
| `REVIEW_REQUIRED` | Continue. Save this state as proof that GitHub has a required review still pending. |
| `APPROVED` | Continue. Save this state as proof that GitHub's required review is complete. |
| Any other value, including an empty value | Escape (§ Escape condition 7). The value does not prove a safe required-review state. |

A command failure, unreadable object, non-open pull request, or unavailable review-status read escapes too. This check happens before merge-pr can attempt or arm a merge.

**Run Workflow**: `⤵ workflows/merge-pr.md [PR_NUMBER] § 4-7 → § 5` with `[ISSUE]` as `[ISSUE_ID]`, `[PR_BRANCH]` as `[BRANCH]`, `[STATE_KEY]` as `[ISSUE_ID]`, and `[MICRO_REVIEW_STATE]` as the saved value.

Its § 3 is skipped, so nothing waits on CI or on a reviewer before the arm. § 5 step 1 attempts the prepared head and owns the queue wait to a terminal verdict. A saved `REVIEW_REQUIRED` state lets an otherwise clear `cause: none` refusal arm auto-merge for that pending decision. A saved `APPROVED` state grants no such exception. The gate mode resolved above is what an arm waits on.

A § 5 step 1 refusal outside `ci_pending` and the guarded `REVIEW_REQUIRED` plus `cause: none` route returns to its § 3.2, which reads the `CHECK` object only the skipped § 3 produces. That return escapes (§ Escape condition 8).

A `dequeued` verdict routes to that step's late-findings triage. A finding there that needs a change § Escape excludes ends this run at the escape instead.

## 5. Return

Output: [Lane Output](../references/skill-rules.md#lane-output).

<output_format>

### MICRO — [ISSUE_ID]: [TITLE]

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| PR | #[PR_NUMBER] |
| Merge | [MERGE_SHA] or the merge-pr verdict that stopped it |
| Size | [PRODUCTION] production, [TEST] test lines |
| Dev phase | [MINUTES], against the § Budget target for the route |
| Checkout | the branch the main checkout ends on, or `lane` |
| Escaped | no, or the § Escape condition and the handback it names |

</output_format>

## Escape

The tier holds only while the item and its change stay inside it. Each condition below ends the run:

1. § 1 read a container, a blocked child, or a bundle. This tier implements one item's own Done-when and nothing else.
2. The repository's commit chain is not armed, or the answer could not be read.
3. The edit reached a file that gates a merge, runs in a commit or turn hook, enforces a guard rule, launches a lane, or sets this tier's own boundary: this workflow, [oversee.md](oversee.md) § Item Tier, and the scripts §§ 2-3 measure the run with, `install-git-hooks` and `branch-size-check`. § 2 step 3 reads the changed paths against this class. [references/narrow-change.conf](../references/narrow-change.conf) holds that class as globs a script can read, together with the schema, lock-format and manifest paths the wider `small` class also refuses; every `path` line there escapes this tier, so a reader checks a path against the whole list. It also carries this tier's production ceiling, which [oversee.md](oversee.md) § Item Tier selects on.
4. The commit chain refuses the commit over a repository rule. A missing changelog fragment and a rejected commit message are this workflow's own to fix and are not escapes.
5. `branch-size-check` reports `over`.
6. A review finding on the pull request needs a change condition 3 or 5 excludes.
7. § 4 cannot prove through `pr-merge --check` that GitHub's required-review state is `REVIEW_REQUIRED` or `APPROVED`. This includes `off`, `review`, an unreadable gate result, a `review_fetch_failed:` issue, and an empty or other `.review` value. An unavailable review-status read stays a fetch failure; an empty value alone proves no safe review state.
8. merge-pr.md § 5 step 1 returns to its § 3.2.

Ending the run leaves the branch and its commits where they stand and reports the condition in § 5. **Main checkout only**, use the route below before reporting. It owns the base-branch restore this file opens with.

The item then relaunches at the `standard` tier, by the route the checkout leaves it on:

- **In a lane**, `/orch start [ISSUE_ID]` routes a worktree cwd to [start-worktree.md](start-worktree.md) ([start.md](start.md) § 1 step 3), whose § 1 resolves the item from the existing branch and whose § 2 implements against it.
- **From the main checkout at condition 1**, no branch was cut: the item takes plain `/orch start [ISSUE_ID]`.
- **From the main checkout at conditions 2 through 4**, the branch is local-only and can be dirty. Transfer it through the worktree owner's guarded path, which restores the main checkout to its default branch and moves staged, unstaged and untracked changes with the branch. Run `/orch start [ISSUE_ID]` from the path it prints:

  ```bash
  .agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree create [ISSUE_ID] --transfer [BRANCH]
  ```

- **From the main checkout at conditions 5 through 8**, the branch was pushed. Restore `[BASE_BRANCH]`, then attach the remote branch with `--pr [PR_NUMBER]` when the pull request exists, or `--base [BRANCH]` before it exists. Run `/orch start [ISSUE_ID]` from the path the command prints:

  ```bash
  git -C [MAIN_REPO_ROOT] checkout [BASE_BRANCH]
  ```

  ```bash
  .agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree create [ISSUE_ID] --pr [PR_NUMBER]
  ```

  ```bash
  .agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree create [ISSUE_ID] --base [BRANCH]
  ```

A run never continues past its own escape, and never re-enters this workflow for the same item.
