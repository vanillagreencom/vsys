# Oversee

Standing fleet mode: burn down unblocked work items by launching one orch session per item and shepherding every PR to merge. The overseer launches, watches, unblocks, and merges — it never implements or reviews. It runs unattended: a blocked lane is the overseer's to unblock, not the user's to notice.

## 1. Resolve The Launch Surface

Once per session, first match wins:

1. `$TMUX` set → tmux lanes: launch each item with `open-terminal` (`lanes pick` chooses the account lane; launch flags sized per item — `handoff.md` § 2).
2. The harness ships session or thread launching (Codex threads, Claude Code agent teams, a desktop app's session tool or bundled skill) → use it: one managed session per item, carrying the same brief `open-terminal` would render.
3. Neither → no parallel surface. Say so once and work the queue sequentially in this session: `start [ISSUE_ID]` per item, § 2 selection between items.

On a non-tmux surface, read lane questions, new tracker items, and session banners through the harness's own session and tracker tooling.

Then read the overseer handoff file the fleet brief names (default `docs/handoff/OVERSEER-HANDOFF.md`; tracked or gitignored is the repo's choice): the prior session's live lanes, sequence and standing rulings. Absent, start from the tracker. § 5 rewrites it.

## 2. Select Work

Unblocked, non-terminal items from the tracker, gated exactly as `start.md` gates them (ancestor chain, blocker union, container rules). A GitHub item labeled `blocked` is not a candidate. An item whose `worktree create` exits 75 belongs to another session: skip it; its siblings still launch. On the tmux surface that claim IS `open-terminal`'s own worktree create — never pre-create the worktree. A surface that creates its own worktree environment (Codex app threads) records the claim in workflow-state before launch. Oversee runs as at most one session per repo. Read the lane cap and keep at most that many items in flight:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/orch-env ORCH_OVERSEER_LANES 3
```

## 3. Launch

Per item, mint the brief `/orch start [ISSUE_ID]` (or `/orch start github [OWNER/REPO]#[N]`). The brief also carries question routing: "If your harness can message other sessions (a session list plus a send-message tool), push any blocking question to the overseer session that launched you the moment it arises — the user may not be watching this session — and still raise it locally through your normal question tool. Without such messaging, just ask normally; the overseer's watch will find it." `/orch` slash syntax does nothing in Codex: a Codex CLI lane uses the form open-terminal renders — `Read .agents/skills/orch/SKILL.md and execute the orch start workflow for [ITEM]` — and a Codex Desktop thread uses `$orch start [ITEM]` (`handoff.md` § 2). Size launch flags to the item, read `[NOW]` for the lane record below, then launch on the § 1 surface.

A fleet with held merges runs every lane under `ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY=ask`; the fleet brief chooses, and `auto` stays the default. On the tmux surface set it in the overseer's tmux session before the first launch, so every lane window inherits it; on surface 2, pass it in the launcher's environment. The lane's merge question then reaches the overseer as `lane-asking` (§ 4 Held merges).

```bash
tmux set-environment ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY ask
```

Record the lane. Read `[NOW]` as `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` before the launch it timestamps, never after; the first lane's value is the fleet start that § 4 passes as `--since`. First use only — when `exists` reports false, run `init` (init overwrites: never re-init a live lane log):

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state exists --json oversee
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state init oversee
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state append oversee lanes '{"issue":"[ISSUE_ID]","surface":"[SURFACE]","launched_at":"[NOW]"}'
```

## 4. Watch And Advance

One blocking command, passed the fleet's start as `--since` (the first lane's `launched_at` — the same value on every run, never "now"), `--item` for every live item, `--repo` for every repository the fleet has PRs in, and every live lane's tmux window name, as `session:window` when the lane lives in another tmux session (none on a non-tmux surface). It prints every event the pass found as one block, each line prefixed with its kind (`EVENT <kind>`, one line per item for `merged` and `triage`, a pane tail or record under the lines that carry one), and exits once, so no kind starves another — handle every line. An `EVENT` line on stdout is handled even when the watch exits non-zero: handle it, fix what stderr names, then re-run. Re-run it after handling each event with the live set updated — a merged item and a dead lane's window drop out. Never hand-roll a monitor. It runs `pr-watch.sh` when the review-gate skill is installed and skips that step otherwise (`gate-stale` is then invisible — [references/gates.md](../references/gates.md) § Multi-PR watching); the `triage` check arms only when `LINEAR_TEAM` is set, so a fleet on a repo tracking its work elsewhere runs the same command and is told once on stderr that triage is off; the reducer covers every `--repo`, each keeping its own baseline, and prefixes every line with the repo it came from; only a new `<pr> <kind>` line is itself an event; attention standing since the fleet's first run is context appended to the next event. A PR in a repo no `--repo` names is unwatched, so a fleet shepherding work into consumer repos names each of them, the repo holding the items FIRST: `merged` and the heartbeat's open-PR list read every one, each line naming its repo, and the first one's baseline holds the triage, lane and merged rows. A line already delivered is not repeated by a re-run: a merged item still in `--item`, a lane parked on its wall, left at a bare shell, or sitting idle at the same screen is reported once, until what it reports changes. Inside tmux, a run naming items and no lane window is told once on stderr which pane checks it skips.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/oversee-watch --interval 240 --since [FLEET_SINCE] --item [ISSUE_ID]... --repo [ITEMS_REPO] --repo [OTHER_REPO]... [LANE_WINDOW...]
```

### Judgement at every event

The overseer owns fleet judgement, not just liveness; every § 4 event is handled under these rules:

- **Heartbeat backstop for lane filings.** Read every issue a lane creates — the `heartbeat` triage pass below surfaces them. A hypothetical, an unreproduced edge case, or a feature no issue's Done-when carries is canceled with a comment naming what it failed; genuine defects stay. Cancel only where the fleet brief grants triage authority and the lane's authorship is beyond doubt; any uncertainty means comment the recommendation and leave the issue open — elsewhere the project-management skill's approval gate stays the rule.
- **Cut scope blowups.** A PR whose diff outgrows its issue's Done-when goes back to the contract: keep the oversized work on a branch, land the contract. Machinery no issue ordered — a new subsystem, scanner, or lexer — is cut, never reviewed into shape.
- **End spirals.** A round whose finding shares a root cause with one a prior round patched is dispositioned by [references/finding-disposition.md § Recurrence](../references/finding-disposition.md#recurrence), which states the branches and their limits. Bots drip-feeding one class get the class exhausted in one audit pass, then dispositions without pushes. After five bot rounds on one PR, the lane answers the standing threads once and the overseer admin-merges it itself (`gh pr merge --squash --admin`), the explicit answer `merge-pr.md` reserves for a person or the overseer; no further round. The overseer never orders a blanket `Declined` across a PR's open findings: each one is dispositioned on its own mechanism, and a decline that is nothing but a label turns the gate red.
- **Fix the source.** The same finding class on a third PR is a mechanism gap: file it and route the smallest deterministic check (a guard lane, a preflight rule, a refusing script) or one sentence in the owning skill through a lane as its own item — the overseer still implements nothing. Deterministic beats prose where it stays simple; complex or brittle machinery is worse than either.
- **Rule once for the fleet.** A ruling that answers one lane's question is sent to every lane in the same situation and recorded in the fleet log.
- **Held merges.** Under `ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY=ask` (§ 3) the lane's merge question arrives as `lane-asking`. Review the PR body, the non-render file list, the source-side diff stat, failing checks and open threads; read the source itself only for gate, guard, installer or CI changes; re-run any proof the body claims when it costs one command (a grep, a count, a green run): the claim is not the evidence. Answer `MERGE` or exactly one directive naming the change, never a second round; a directive may carry the MERGE ("with that landed, MERGE stands"), and the lane then merges once the change is in without a second answer. Under `ask` a `disarmed` pr-watch line is not a wake.
- **Hand off a lane before it runs out.** On the § 1 tmux surface, at every § 4 event, read each live lane's context use:

  ```bash
  .agents/skills/orch/scripts/lanes context
  ```

  The mark is `CONTEXT_TOKENS` past about 500000, an absolute count and never a percentage. Only a lane whose status line names a window of 1M tokens or more reaches it (Claude Fable and Opus at 1M); a lane on a smaller window or naming none (Codex at its 500k configuration, Pi at default, any 200k model) shows no figure, never reaches the mark, and keeps its harness's own compaction. Past the mark, at the lane's next safe point (a merge landed, a PR held; never mid-round or with an unpushed tree), tell the lane to hand off. The lane records the fixed shape below and exits; the watch reports `handoff [ISSUE_ID]` once; relaunch the item with `open-terminal --relaunch` (§ 3), whose `start` resumes from the record (`start.md` step 0).

  ```bash
  .agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state set [ISSUE_ID] handoff '{"written_at":"[NOW]","merged":["[PR]"],"remaining":["[STEP]"],"branch":"[BRANCH]","worktree":"[WORKTREE_PATH]","open_pr":[PR_NUMBER_OR_NULL],"traps":["[TRAP]"]}'
  ```

  The record, the event and the relaunch are surface-independent. Surfaces 2 and 3 register no lane claim, so `lanes context` reports an empty fleet there: on surface 2 read a lane's context through the harness's own session tooling and hand off at the same mark; surface 3 has no lane to hand off.

- **Decide without the user.** SKILL.md's ask gates stand unchanged — scope expansion, recorded decisions, and merge autonomy still ask. Any other reversible call takes the option that costs nothing, recorded in the fleet log; destructive actions and product direction wait for a human.


- `merged` → the PR is in; the owning lane finishes `merge-pr.md` § 5 on its own and a GitHub merge alone is not lane completion. Wake it only if it is not still inside that run, and read a reported failure there rather than advancing the item. Then run the repo's post-merge routine in the overseer main checkout: pull the merged base, build, refresh, verify, and run its lifecycle check. When the fleet's LAST item completes, run the `heartbeat` triage pass before closing out, whatever the tracker; items living in Linear also get `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/reconcile-work-items` (a GitHub-item fleet skips that with a note). Report both with the close-out.
- `lane-exited` → the window is alive but the harness under it is gone (its pane tail says why). A lane stopped by a harness session limit ("You've hit your session limit · resets 9:50am") is not dead: resume it under another auth lane (`lanes pick`, then the recipe under § Talking to a lane), or wait for the shown reset and send the lane a one-line continuation nudge. A lane that reported `handoff` on an earlier run is relaunched per that event, not resumed or nudged. Any other exit is the `window-gone` rule below.
- `handoff` → the item's lane recorded its handoff and exited: relaunch it per § 4 Hand off a lane; the record follows the event line.
- `usage-limit` → read the pane tail first and confirm the banner is the harness's own, not text the lane printed while working; a lane still working is left alone. Confirmed: move the item to another account lane (kill the window, then re-run the § 3 launch with `--relaunch --lane auto:[HARNESS]` — bare `auto` needs `--harness`), or wait for the reset and send the lane a one-line continuation nudge. The event's `resets=` is that reset in UTC. A banner naming a date states it outright; one naming only a clock or a weekday states no day, so `resets=` is the first occurrence after this watch's own first sighting of that banner — an upper bound, up to a day later than the truth for a clock and a week for a weekday, on a wall the watch did not see standing. Nothing on the event separates the two, so read the tail. Without `resets=` the banner either named no reset in a readable shape or named a time zone this host cannot resolve. Never launch onto the spent account again until its reset, and never park a lane against an estimate of your own when `resets=` states the time. A parked lane stays in the watch: its window is what announces the reset, as `usage-limit-passed`. A wall reported without `resets=` is announced once and nothing announces it again, so it is resolved on that event (move the item to another account lane), never parked.
- `usage-limit-passed` → read the pane tail first, as for `usage-limit` above: a lane still working is left alone. Confirmed, the wall named by `resets=` has already lifted and the lane is still sitting under the old banner. Send it a one-line continuation nudge; do not move the item and do not wait. The nudge is the whole remedy: this event never licenses a fresh launch onto that account, and a nudge that does not take means the wall still stands. A banner naming only a clock or a weekday reaches this event only once this watch has itself seen that wall standing; until then the lane reports `usage-limit`, however old the reset looks. A banner naming a date needs no sighting: it states its own day, and a date behind us is spent on sight.
- `idle-after-return` → read its pane tail. A lane that has returned is available for another fleet launch; a lane still inside `merge-pr.md` § 5 step 1 is blocked on its queue wait, which reads as work in flight rather than idle.
- A lane whose session ended AFTER its PR merged but before `merge-pr.md` § 5 steps 2-6 finished → relaunch it into `merge-pr [PR_NUMBER]`. That run's already-merged route skips the merge and runs the tracker sync, project verification and worktree removal the dead lane never reached. The rule below does not reach this lane: its PR did merge.
- `window-gone`, or any lane whose session ended with no merged PR → inspect its worktree and PR state, re-launch once with the same brief and `open-terminal --relaunch` (without the flag the existing worktree reads as another session's claim and the item is skipped); a second death is surfaced to the user, not retried.
- `lane-asking` → read the pane, answer when available evidence already decides it, apply the ruling, and record it in the fleet log. Repo state, the issue body, a stated convention, scope-narrowing calls, and a lane's own well-argued recommendation are available evidence. Relay to the user only what changes the product for a user or spends the owner's standing (retiring a reviewer, filing outside the repo, closing as won't-do). Either way, send the answer back to the lane. On a surface with neither messaging nor an inspectable pane, prolonged lane silence is itself the needs-attention signal — inspect the session through that surface's own status tools.
- `triage` → team-wide: apply the filing bar to every emitted team item, regardless of lane authorship. Route a kept item or cancel it, then record a kept or canceled verdict in the fleet state's `triaged` list before re-running the watch. An emitted item is never left without that record. triaged is the verdict log, not the watcher baseline. The watcher rebuilds acknowledged triage keys from it in the first repository's OVERSEE_WATCH_STATE_DIR baseline; the default directory is `<project-root>/tmp/oversee-watch`. Deleting that baseline resets watcher dedup: the next pass rebuilds kept and canceled keys, while pending items emit again.
- `pr-watch` → handle every attention line. What each kind MEANS is `pr-watch.sh --help`; what follows is only what the overseer does about it. A detail ending in `(QUEUED: dequeue before pushing)` rides several kinds and outranks all of them: the lane dequeues before it can push anything.
  - `gate-stale` → healed only where a `heal-dispatched` line rides the same reduction. The reducer re-dispatches on every pass the line stands, so a standing line is dispatch-to-converge lag, not a queue of work: judge it on whether the dispatched writer run COMPLETED, never on a pass count, and read a cancelled pending duplicate in the writer's concurrency group as ordinary lag too. A standing line comes back only as reducer output appended to the next wake or heartbeat, never as a fresh event. Beside an `error` naming a failed writer dispatch, nothing was healed and the once-per-invocation budget is spent, so no other stale PR got a dispatch either: fix the dispatch path for the repo the line names before waiting on another pass, the workflow name against `PR_WATCH_WRITER_WORKFLOW`, `actions:write` on the credential, Actions enabled on that repo.
  - `heal-dispatched` → the reducer's note that this invocation's one dispatch fired. Nothing to do, and never an event on its own.
  - `threads-open` → verify the count against the API, then wake the owning lane with it.
  - `changes-requested` → wake the owning lane: a standing objection is the lane's to answer, never the overseer's to dismiss.
  - `untracked-claim`, `unreasoned-decline` → wake the lane to rewrite the reply per [references/finding-disposition.md](../references/finding-disposition.md); the gate stays red until it does.
  - `disarmed` → under `ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY=auto`, wake the lane to arm auto-merge; under `ask` it is not a wake, the lane holds the PR for § 4 Held merges. Arming stays the lane's reply-pass discipline; the overseer never adopts it as its own step. A detail marked `UNCONFIRMED` came from a cheap-mode reducer, and that one is evaluated before anyone arms.
  - `awaiting-stale` → trigger a re-review, or apply the fleet's on-timeout policy.
  - `head-moved` → the reduction describes the old head. Re-run the watch; nothing else.
  - `error` → many producers, and each line's own detail carries its remedy: follow that. One exception, whose remedy the detail does not carry: `writer dispatch failed for …` means fixing the dispatch path, never re-running, since a re-run re-attempts the same failing dispatch. An unevaluated PR is never healthy.
- `heartbeat` → the triage pass: `.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh issues list --team [TEAM] --created-since [Nd covering the fleet start] --max` (or the tracker's equivalent), drop IDs already recorded in the fleet state's `triaged`, and judge only issues a fleet lane filed — the candidate set is each lane item's created-issue records in workflow state (`audit_issues_created`, `pr_comment_review.issues_created`) plus each lane PR body's Created Issues section; the created-since listing backstops trackers without that state. Anything outside the set is left alone. Record each verdict with `workflow-state append oversee triaged '{"issue": "[ID]", "verdict": "[kept|canceled]", "reason": "[ONE_LINE]"}'`, then re-run.

### Talking to a lane

How the overseer reaches a running lane from outside its session, by harness; the Pi commands are the pi-session-bridge CLI, documented in its [README](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/kendex/blob/main/pi-extensions/pi-session-bridge/README.md) and `pi-bridge --help`, and every Pi call selects the lane by `--name` or `--cwd`.

| Harness | Launch | Send a message | Read state | Answer a question |
|---------|--------|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| Claude Code | `open-terminal` into a tmux pane (§ 3). In a tmux pane, a first launch in a folder the wrapper has not trusted shows a trust prompt with "No, exit" selected: `Down`, `Enter`, then relaunch. | `tmux send-keys -t` the lane's window `-l` the text, then `Enter` in a separate call, only at the idle prompt; sent mid-turn it queues. In a tmux pane, a queued message with no running turn ("Press up to edit queued messages") needs one bare `Enter`; a lane under a session limit gets its one-line continuation from a timed waiter at the reset plus one minute. A GUI or app surface has none of these. | Read the status file the lane's brief names, or the pane tail when it names none; never the transcript. | Move the dialog with the arrow keys and press `Enter` in the lane's pane; the recorded choice line confirms it. The rm-safety prompt ("Dangerous rm operation on possibly-empty variable path") fires even under bypass: read the command, and `Enter` on Yes when it stays inside the lane's own worktree. |
| Codex | `open-terminal` into a tmux pane (§ 3). | `tmux send-keys -t` the lane's window `-l` the text, then `Enter` in a separate call, at the idle prompt only; its queue does not deliver. | Read the status file the lane's brief names, or the pane tail when it names none; never the transcript. | Type the number the dialog shows into the lane's pane, at the idle prompt. |
| Pi | `open-terminal` into a tmux pane (§ 3). | `pi-bridge send` on the selected lane. | `pi-bridge state` or `history` on the selected lane, never `stream`, which does not return; `pi-bridge questions` lists a pending dialog with its request id. | `pi-bridge answer` on the selected lane with that request id and the option label, never the pane: a typed number lands on the default option. |
| App or other | The session or thread launcher the harness or an app-specific skill exposes (§ 1). | The API or tooling that surface exposes. | The API or tooling that surface exposes. | The API or tooling that surface exposes; a pane at its idle prompt only when nothing else exists. |

A lane never arms the shared git hooks from its worktree; a guard-script PR whose new chain refuses the branch under main's installed scripts is a one-time transition the overseer sequences.

**Resuming a dead or walled Claude Code lane.** The wrappers share session ids in `~/.claude-shared/projects/<cwd-slug>/*.jsonl`; the right file is the newest whose first user line names the issue. Run the wrapper with `--resume <id>` in the lane's window, then send one message to re-arm its waiters.

## 5. Stop

Queue empty, or the user stops it. Report one line per lane: merged SHAs, still-open PRs, items skipped as owned or blocked. Rewrite the § 1 overseer handoff file in place for the next session, and delete stale per-session handoff files beside it at that rewrite, never leave them.
