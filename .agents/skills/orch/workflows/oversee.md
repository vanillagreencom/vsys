# Oversee

Standing fleet mode: burn down unblocked work items by launching one orch session per item and shepherding every PR to merge. The overseer launches, watches and unblocks (lanes merge their PRs) — it never reviews, and it implements nothing but a `micro` item § 3 Item Tier leaves it to run. It runs unattended: a blocked lane is the overseer's to unblock, not the user's to notice.

## 1. Resolve The Launch Surface

Once per session, first match wins:

1. `$TMUX` set → tmux lanes: launch each item with `open-terminal` (`handoff.md` § 2), a claude or codex item, or a pi item on a `github-copilot/` model, under § 3 Lane directive.
2. The harness ships session or thread launching (Codex threads, Claude Code agent teams, a desktop app's session tool or bundled skill) → use it: one managed session per item, carrying the same brief `open-terminal` would render.
3. Neither → no parallel surface. Say so once and work the queue sequentially in this session, running each item's § 3 Item Tier brief: `start [ISSUE_ID]`, `small [ISSUE_ID]`, or [micro.md](micro.md) in this session for a `micro` item, with § 2 selection between items. On a hosted fleet this session runs no item: [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § The Cycle, Item work stays in lanes.

A lane's questions arrive at least once as `lane-question` and new tracker items as `triage`, both from the § 4 watch, on every surface. Only session banners are surface-specific: off the tmux surface, read them through the harness's own session tooling.

The owner sends the overseer a note without typing into its pane: `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail send --item overseer --directive --file [PATH]`, run from any checkout of the project (`lane-mail --help`), and the § 4 watch reports it at least once as `owner-note`; a note typed into the chat is acted on the same way. A reply owed to a note is `lane-mail notice --item overseer --to owner --ref [NOTE_ID] --file [PATH]`, so the owner reads it where the note was written. Every question for the owner is an owner ask ([references/communication-modes.md § Owner asks](../references/communication-modes.md#owner-asks)), never a question dialog. A peer repository's overseer writes the same mailbox, reported as `peer-note` ([references/peer-mail.md](../references/peer-mail.md)). Both are the watch's to report while it runs as a repeat; with the watch in single passes, this session's own lane-mail hooks hand those notes over instead, as `lane-mail-check: unread=` lines at its turn end and after its tool calls, and no pass reports them ([references/peer-mail.md § Who reads a note](../references/peer-mail.md#who-reads-a-note)).

A session a person opened by hand registers itself first, so the hooks and the watch know which session is the overseer: `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/oversee register`. A session `oversee launch` or a succession opened is already recorded.

First in every session, before the handoff file, read that mailbox: `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail inbox --item overseer` prints every note no reader has taken yet and moves the mailbox's own cursor past them. Act on each or record it in the fleet log. The § 4 watch reads through the same cursor, so it does not report them again, save a note it had read before this and not yet acknowledged; a repeated note id is one already seen. What is still owed either way is `lane-mail pending --item overseer` (`lane-mail --help`).

Then read the overseer handoff file the fleet brief names (default `tmp/handoffs/OVERSEER-HANDOFF.md`): the prior session's live lanes, sequence and standing rulings. Absent, start from the tracker; with no item, no handoff file, no note and no owner ask `lane-mail pending --item overseer --to owner` lists, send the [§ Opening question](../references/communication-modes.md#opening-question) with its options and recommendation, and wait for its resolution through § 4; with one listed, wait for that ask's resolution instead. `kendex apply` ignores the default path through `/tmp/`. For a custom path inside a repository, verify before the first read and each write that Git's index has no entry for the file and Git's ignore rules cover the path. If either check fails, stop and report the path. The handoff stays local to the overseer's host, which owns its disk or snapshot persistence, including paths outside a repository. § 5 rewrites it. Then read `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state fleet-log takeover`, the last `ORCH_TAKEOVER_ROWS` fleet log rows other than `cycle` rows, and no other part of the fleet log.

## 2. Select Work

Unblocked, non-terminal items from the tracker, gated exactly as `start.md` gates them (ancestor chain, blocker union, container rules). The fleet state's `launch_queue` holds the order; its membership is the tracker's, never handoff memory: every heartbeat names each owed tracker item the queue lacks as an `owed` line under [oversee-events.md § Event kinds](../references/oversee-events.md#event-kinds) `heartbeat`, which routes each verdict. A GitHub item labeled `blocked` is not a candidate. An item whose `worktree create` exits 75 belongs to another session: skip it; its siblings still launch. On the tmux surface that claim IS `open-terminal`'s own worktree create — never pre-create the worktree. A surface that creates its own worktree environment (Codex app threads) records the claim in workflow-state before launch. Oversee runs as at most one session per repo. `open-terminal --state-dir` enforces `ORCH_OVERSEER_LANES` per fleet and `ORCH_LANE_ACCOUNT_CLAIMS` per account (`--help`). Select no more items than the fleet cap has room for; on other surfaces keep at most that many in flight yourself:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/orch-env ORCH_OVERSEER_LANES 3
```

## 3. Launch

### Item Tier

Every selected item takes a tier before it launches. `item-tier` assigns it, and its `--help` owns the rule:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/item-tier --production [ESTIMATE] --path [LOCATION_PATH] --repo [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]
```

`[ESTIMATE]` is this session's estimate of the production lines the item adds, made from the body read once under § Lane directive step 2. An `**Expected delta**` line is one input to that estimate and never the tier source; `branch-size-check --help` owns that line. Pass one `--path` per file the item's `**Location**` names, and none when it names none. The output line's `brief=` word is the brief § Lane directive mints:

- `micro`: `/orch micro [ISSUE_ID]`, which runs [micro.md](micro.md): no dev subagent, no review cycle, no QA cycle.
- `small`: `/orch small [ISSUE_ID]`, which runs [small.md](small.md): the standard session under thin review bounds.
- `start`: `/orch start [ISSUE_ID]`, the `standard` tier, as the rest of this section states.

A `micro` item launches as a lane like any other, sized under § Lane directive step 2 at the simplest complexity it names, and always with `--cmd`. On a hosted fleet it launches only that way, waiting for a free lane ([SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § The Cycle, Item work stays in lanes). Otherwise, with no lane free, or on the § 1 no-parallel surface, the overseer runs [micro.md](micro.md) in this session from the main checkout; that run holds the checkout on the item's branch until § 3 there returns it to the base, so start it between events and never beside another read of the base checkout.

A run that ends at [micro.md](micro.md) § Escape or [small.md](small.md) § Escape comes back as an item to launch at the next class up, on the branch it left. So does a run that stops without reaching an escape, a failed push or create among the causes. Run `item-tier` again with `--floor` naming the class above the one the run held, and only that when no branch holds a commit past `origin/[BASE_BRANCH]`. Otherwise add `--base origin/[BASE_BRANCH] --head [HEAD_REF] --repo [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]`: `[HEAD_REF]` is `origin/[BRANCH]` once a pushed branch is fetched, else the local `[BRANCH]` every worktree on this host shares. A hosted lane's unpushed branch exists only on its host, so that lane runs the line with its worktree as `--repo`. Read a micro run's § 5 `Checkout` value: a main checkout still on the item's branch is returned to the base before the next launch.

### Lane directive

A launch through `open-terminal` on the tmux surface for the claude or codex harness, whose launcher takes a lane config dir, takes these steps in order, local or on a remote control host. A pi launch on a `github-copilot/` model takes steps 2 to 4 with `--harness pi`: it spends the Copilot pool, which `lanes pick` judges on `ORCH_LANE_COPILOT_POOL` (`lanes --help`) as its monthly window and never on a Claude or Codex window; its refusals are answered as [lane-directive.md § No lane has room](../references/lane-directive.md#no-lane-has-room) says for a pi pick. Every other surface or harness launches as § 1 says, with no inventory or pick.

1. Inventory: `lanes list`. On a control host the inventory is that host's login dirs. On a hosted fleet it also carries the provider's own reading of each account it holds a credential for; the `THROUGH` column, `measured_through` under `--json`, says which credential measured each row, and the two readings of one account can disagree.
2. Size: read the item's body once and make a quick judgement of its complexity (a colour, data, docs or bounded one-function fix; a mechanism change across one subsystem; a correctness predicate with several interacting writers or a review already past its round bound), and pick the model and the reasoning effort that complexity needs. Every launch names both. The model is sized BEFORE the lane, because it is what the lane is judged on: an account with plan-wide room can have none left for one model, and choosing the lane first picks an account the launch then opens a usage banner on. Never pick a weaker model because a lane is near its wall: pick another lane.
3. Choose: `lanes pick --harness [HARNESS] --model [MODEL] --json`, naming the model step 2 sized, and launch on the lane it returns rather than naming one by hand. The threshold is read against the highest usage in the shared 5-hour window, the all-model weekly window, the named model's scoped weekly window, and for a pi pick the monthly Copilot pool. A shared window can wall every model even when the scoped model window has room. The returned `binding_bucket` names the window that decided. Each lane already live on an account is charged its expected burn first, so `claims`, `burn_pct_per_lane_hour` and `projected_headroom_pct` say why the account was chosen. It never returns this fleet's overseer account, nor a peer fleet's while that fleet runs a lane in the shared claim store (`lanes --help`, pick). A lane whose windows measure nothing for the model is dropped rather than treated as free. Exit 3 means no lane has room for that model, and nothing launches: [lane-directive.md § No lane has room](../references/lane-directive.md#no-lane-has-room) says what to read, wait on and report. Pass the model in the text the launch runs: inside the `--cmd` command where the launch carries its own harness argv, and in `--launch-flags` where it does not. The launcher records it beside the lane.
4. Launch: the `handoff.md` § 2 `open-terminal` invocation plus `--lane [CONFIG_DIR]` from the picked record, the sized model and effort in the text that launch runs, and `--state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR]` (§ Lane record), one item per launch. A fleet launch carries its brief in `--cmd`, so its model, effort and permission flags go inside that command and never in `--launch-flags`; a launch without `--cmd` puts them in `--launch-flags`. [lane-directive.md § Launch gate](../references/lane-directive.md#launch-gate) holds how `open-terminal` judges the launch and what each refusal licenses.

Launch caps and their refusals: [lane-directive.md § Caps](../references/lane-directive.md#caps).

Placement: before each launch, read `lane-host resolve`; any value but `local` makes a hosted fleet. There every launch this directive makes adds `--host [HOST]`, and any other surface or harness is reported, never launched locally. `start` never launches a hosted lane: only `oversee` and `handoff` launch through `open-terminal --host`. Under [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § The Cycle, Item work stays in lanes, every item launches as a hosted lane through this directive, and a session with no tmux surface reports the queue once, naming that surface as the route. The credential reaches the sandbox per [schemas/lane-host.md](../schemas/lane-host.md) § Provider protocol, with no local `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` prefix.

Per item, mint the brief § Item Tier assigned (or its `github [OWNER/REPO]#[N]` spelling). The brief also carries question routing: "Every question for the overseer goes through `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail` in this worktree, per [skill-rules.md § Coordination](../references/skill-rules.md#coordination): `lane-mail ask --item [ISSUE_ID] --file [PATH]`, then `lane-mail wait` on the printed id. Never use your harness's question tool. Read `lane-mail inbox --item [ISSUE_ID]` at every wait point." A lane whose harness has an Arm in [watch-delivery.md](../references/watch-delivery.md#lane-mailbox-monitor) also gets its brief line. `/orch` slash syntax does nothing in Codex: a Codex CLI lane uses the form open-terminal renders — `Read .agents/skills/orch/SKILL.md and execute the orch start workflow for [ITEM]` — and a Codex Desktop thread uses `$orch start [ITEM]` (`handoff.md` § 2); a pi lane takes `/skill:orch start [ITEM]`, a Copilot CLI lane the Codex CLI prose form, which open-terminal passes as the value of `-i`, and an opencode lane the `/orch` form. At the `micro` and `small` tiers each of those reads the tier's `brief=` word where it reads `start`. A `micro` or `small` item therefore always launches with `--cmd` carrying its brief: `open-terminal`'s own template renders `start` for every tracker and harness pair it handles, so a launch without `--cmd` runs the standard cycle whatever the tier said. Size launch flags to the item, then launch on the § 1 surface.

A fleet brief can require user authorization for each merge with `ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY=ask`; `auto` stays the default. This setting is merge authorization, not an overseer validation grant. On the tmux surface set it in the overseer's tmux session before the first launch, so every lane window inherits it; on surface 2, pass it in the launcher's environment. The lane's merge question then reaches the overseer as `lane-question` ([oversee-events.md § Held merges](../references/oversee-events.md#judgement-rules)).

```bash
tmux set-environment ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY ask
```

Resolve `ORCH_USER_MODE` once for every question this fleet relays to the user:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/orch-env ORCH_USER_MODE ceo
```

The launch brief identifies the overseer and names `tmp/lane-status-[ISSUE_ID].md` and the mailbox `tmp/lane-mail/[ISSUE_ID]/`, both under the lane's worktree, which its record carries as `mail_root`. It directs the lane to initialize and rewrite the status file with its current step, blocker, handoff paths and validation minutes per round. The file holds at most 40 non-empty lines. The lane follows [skill-rules.md § Coordination](../references/skill-rules.md#coordination) for issue proposals and for every ask. For terminal launches, use `open-terminal --cmd` with the full harness command, and `--state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR]`. A `--cmd` command carries the chosen model, effort and permission flags, the question-tool words, and that brief INSIDE it as a bare `{brief}` ([Brief file](../references/lane-directive.md#brief-file)): the template is rendered verbatim, so `--launch-flags` beside it reach nothing and are refused.

### Recovery relaunch

A dead or walled terminal lane uses native resume, as [lane-directive.md § Recovery relaunch](../references/lane-directive.md#recovery-relaunch) states.

### Lane record

The fleet's record is the oversee workflow state ([schemas/workflow-state.md § Oversee state](../schemas/workflow-state.md#oversee-state)), at one address for the whole session: `[OVERSEE_STATE]` is the file `workflow-state path oversee` prints from the overseer's checkout, which § 4 passes as `--state`, and `[OVERSEE_STATE_DIR]` is the directory it sits in, which every `open-terminal` launch, relaunch and wake passes as `--state-dir`, so a launch run from another repository records into the same fleet and not into that repository's own state.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state path oversee
```

On the tmux surface `open-terminal` creates the state on the first launch and records every lane it launches, relaunches or wakes as one `lanes[]` entry; nothing is written by hand. [lane-directive.md § Tmux session](../references/lane-directive.md#tmux-session) names the tmux session its windows open in. On surface 2 and surface 3 the overseer's first hand-written write creates it: a surface-2 lane record below, or a `fleet_log` or `triaged` append ([oversee-events.md](../references/oversee-events.md)). Before that first write, when `exists` reports false, run `init` (init overwrites: never re-init a live fleet state):

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state exists --json oversee
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state init oversee
```

A record's `item` is the lane's record key, `[ITEM_KEY]` throughout this workflow: the Linear id for a Linear item and `issue-N` for a GitHub item, as `open-terminal` records it and `oversee-watch` names it, never the `[OWNER/REPO]#[N]` the brief spells. On surface 2, whose launcher is the harness's own, append the same record after the launch, with `window` null:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state append oversee lanes '{"item":"[ITEM_KEY]","tracker":"[TRACKER]","repo":"[OWNER/REPO_OR_NULL]","harness":"[HARNESS]","window":null,"account":null,"host":null,"mail_root":"[LANE_WORKTREE]","surface":"[SURFACE]","model":"[MODEL]","session_id":null,"launched_at":"[NOW]","status":"running"}'
```

`[NOW]` is `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`, read before the launch it timestamps and never after, because the first record's `launched_at` is the fleet start that § 4 passes as `--since`:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get oversee '.lanes[0].launched_at'
```

`mail_root` is the lane's worktree path as its own host sees it, and the lane's status file is `[MAIL_ROOT]/tmp/lane-status-[ISSUE_ID].md`. Every later mailbox call for a lane whose record carries `host` runs with `ORCH_LANE_HOST` set to that value and names the root: `lane-mail send --root [MAIL_ROOT] --host`, and `lane-host cat` or `touch`; `lane-close` reads the host from the record. A lane on this host needs neither, and a local lane whose `mail_root` is a worktree of another repository still takes `--root [MAIL_ROOT]`, run from a checkout of that repository: `lane-mail` refuses a cross-repository `send` as `lane-foreign`.

## 4. Watch And Advance

One watch command runs for the whole session, launched and read as § Watch delivery states: repeat mode under the orch job runner, or single passes without `--repeat` where the harness wakes only at a background command's exit. Pass the fleet's start as `--since`. Use the first record's `launched_at`, which stays the same on every pass. Pass `--state [OVERSEE_STATE]` with the file that § 3 Lane record resolves. Before every pass, and before every loop that a quiet pass makes, the watch reads every `lanes[]` record whose status is `running`. It reads the item, its window, and its `mail_root`. It uses the named host for a record that has one. Automatic close uses the directory containing `[OVERSEE_STATE]`; each lane's own workflow-state reads keep their lane-specific location. A lane launch, relaunch, or close while the watch runs needs no watch restart. Each pass prints every event it found as one block in the shape that `oversee-watch --help` states. Handle every line, even when its pass exits nonzero. Fix the cause that stderr names. The next pass starts after the `--repeat` delay. `lane-close` is the only terminal-lane close-out; [lane-reach.md § Lane close](../references/lane-reach.md#lane-close) holds how it ends a lane, what each refusal asks, and each surface's close. A successful dead-overseer or walled-overseer succession makes the single pass exit 3. The repeat command converts that status to 0 and stops because the successor runs its own watch. Notice-only recovery, an exhausted retry, and a blocked recovery that no account in the fleet qualifies for also stop the repeat command with status 0, so a manual replacement starts one new watch and owns the overseer mailbox. Do not restart the old watch after any of those stops. For any other exit, fix the cause that stderr names and start it again. Never hand-roll a monitor. Without the review-gate skill, the watch skips its pr-watch step and `gate-stale` is invisible ([references/gates.md](../references/gates.md) § Multi-PR watching). `LINEAR_TEAM` enables triage. A fleet that tracks work elsewhere runs the same command and gets one stderr notice that triage is off. A repeated pr-watch line becomes context for the next event rather than an event of its own. A pull request in a repository that no `--repo` names is unwatched. Name each repository that the fleet uses, with the item repository first. `merged` and the heartbeat's open pull request list read every repository. The first repository's baseline holds the triage, lane, and merged rows. With `--state`, `owed` lines read the tracker once: `LINEAR_TEAM`'s In Progress and In Review items or, with no team, the first repository's open `issue-N` pull requests.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-close --state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR] [ITEM_KEY]
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/oversee-watch --repeat 60 --state [OVERSEE_STATE] --interval 240 --since [FLEET_SINCE] --harness [HARNESS] --repo [ITEMS_REPO] --repo [OTHER_REPO]... -- [FLAGS]
```

`[HARNESS]` is the harness this overseer runs, `claude`, `codex`, `copilot` or `pi`. A Codex or Copilot CLI pane reports `node` and a Pi pane `pi`, which name no one harness, so without it the watch cannot record the launch line before the overseer's first turn end. A Copilot CLI overseer's line opens on the account its record names, so register it with `oversee register --account [DIR]` first; its marks and walls stay unjudged, since `lanes` measures no Copilot account. `[FLAGS]` are the permission flags this overseer runs under, plus its current model and effort flags. Pass all of them even when `ORCH_OVERSEER_PREFERENCE` is set. The watch records this session. A caller or print entry keeps the flags whole except the question-tool words, which a successor carries exactly when `ORCH_QUESTION_TOOL` is off, its default. A named same-harness entry replaces model and effort but keeps the permission words exact. A named cross-harness entry requires one full-bypass mode with an exact equivalent, and no other permission word, and writes the target harness's spelling; none crosses to or from `pi`, whose row has no permission word. Under any other permission posture the walk skips that entry, with `entry-permission-untransferable` on stderr, and goes on to the next one, ending at the caller's own harness. The record binds the launch line to the tmux server, pane and window because a dead pane names neither its model nor its account. Start the watch from the overseer's own pane, with `TMUX_PANE` as that pane's shell sets it, and never unset it: a watch with no pane judges no overseer. A record the start cannot build or write, `overseer-line-missing` or `overseer-unrecorded`, is a notice on stderr and in the fleet log, never a stop: the watch still judges the pane, a wall picks its own account, and a death relaunches from the line the fleet state already holds where its record names this pane by server and pane id, the last line a launch, a succession or a watch start recorded for it, which a session restarted by hand in the same pane may not have been started with, and the start's `held=` field names it; a record naming another pane, or none, reports the death with no successor and names that record. A session launched from a stored token names no account in its environment, so its line takes the account the `overseer` record names. Missing permission flags can stop a caller-entry successor at a prompt. Missing model or effort flags can relaunch it with harness defaults. Where the fleet state's `overseer` record names this pane, it supplies the harness and account of that line ahead of `[HARNESS]`, the pane and the environment, and its model and effort as one pair, only where it names a model ([workflow-state.md § Oversee state](../schemas/workflow-state.md#oversee-state)); the flags supply the permission words, and the model and effort where the record names no model.

`oversee-watch --help` states each refusal at start. After a self-succession the successor's own start takes over the watch `oversee-succeed` restarted and first prints what it reported, under `watch-replayed`: handle those lines as events.

**The watch rule.** A turn never ends while the watch is stopped: it alone resolves an owner ask at its deadline, reported as `owner-ask-resolved`. The watch runs two passes on one clock. The mail pass starts every `ORCH_WATCH_MAIL_INTERVAL` seconds (default 20) and reads every mailbox and the lane records, printing what it finds as it finds it. The long pass, holding pr-watch, the merged check, triage and the pane reads, runs every `--interval` seconds; one that overruns holds up no mail pass. A lane's note is read within one mail interval, whatever `--interval` is, save the delays and the overseer-pane hold `oversee-watch --help` names. The mail pass never reads a lane's pane, so it runs on every surface and outside tmux.

### Watch delivery

Launch, follow and re-arm the repeat watch as [references/watch-delivery.md](../references/watch-delivery.md) states.

### Bounded lane reads

Use the pane payload that `oversee-watch` prints as the lane state, and never read the watch log's tail to handle an event: the follow delivers each line once. Each event carries only the lines its own handling reads, taken from below the lane's last user turn and capped by `ORCH_WATCH_TAIL_LINES`, default 12; which lines each kind carries is `oversee-watch --help` § Events. Do not capture the pane again when that payload answers the event. When the payload does not answer it and what you need is the lane's state rather than its text, run `lanes state [WINDOW]`, whose argument is the lane record's `window` as it stands, `SESSION:WINDOW`, and not the `[ITEM]` used elsewhere here, as the `lanes` help says. It prints one of `working`, `idle`, `asking`, `walled`, `exited` or `unjudged` from the same judge the watch and the wake ask, reading the lane as the watch does; [lane-reach.md § Wake refusals](../references/lane-reach.md#wake-refusals) holds how its words differ from a wake's and what each wake refusal licenses. For a fresh status-file read, use `cp` locally or `lane-host cat` after a successful `lane-host touch` probe on a hosted lane. Run one source line, then the shared filter. Run each line in a separate tool call. The redirection keeps a hosted file out of the overseer until the filter emits its last 40 non-empty lines. A failed probe, source read, or filter stops the event. Never read a lane transcript.

```bash
cp -- [STATUS_FILE] tmp/oversee-lane-status-source
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-host cat --item [ISSUE_ID] [STATUS_FILE] > tmp/oversee-lane-status-source
awk 'NF {line[++count]=$0} END {first=count-39; if (first < 1) first=1; for (i=first; i<=count; i++) print line[i]}' tmp/oversee-lane-status-source
```

### Bounded issue reads

For each `triage` or `heartbeat` pass, replace `[AGE]` with an `Nd` value that covers the fleet start and run each code line in a separate tool call. The first line redirects the complete response to ignored scratch storage, so no issue body enters the overseer. The second line is the only issue-list result the overseer reads. It emits each identifier, title, and `## Done when` body. The last line removes the complete response.

```bash
.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh issues list --team [TEAM] --created-since [AGE] --max --format=raw > tmp/oversee-triage-source.json
jq '[.issues.nodes[] | {identifier, title, done_when: ((("\n" + (.description // "")) | gsub("\r\n"; "\n") | split("\n## Done when\n")) as $sections | if ($sections | length) > 1 then ($sections[1] | split("\n## ")[0] | gsub("^[[:space:]]+|[[:space:]]+$"; "")) else "" end)}]' tmp/oversee-triage-source.json
rm -f tmp/oversee-triage-source.json
```

### Judgement at every event

- Judgement rules for every event: [oversee-events.md § Judgement rules](../references/oversee-events.md#judgement-rules).
- Handling per event kind: [oversee-events.md § Event kinds](../references/oversee-events.md#event-kinds).

### Parking a merge wait

A hosted lane armed or queued for merge is parked: [oversee-lanes.md § Parking a merge wait](../references/oversee-lanes.md#parking-a-merge-wait).

### Talking to a lane

Answering, directing, waking, Pane paste and resuming a dead or walled lane: [oversee-lanes.md § Talking to a lane](../references/oversee-lanes.md#talking-to-a-lane).

## 5. Stop

Queue empty, or the user stops it. A queue empty under a standing `idle` ruling from the [§ Opening question](../references/communication-modes.md#opening-question) is not Stop: the watch keeps running, and the owner's later write arrives through it as an owner note. Stop a detached repeat watch first, as [references/watch-delivery.md](../references/watch-delivery.md) states, then end the follow, so no pass reports this overseer dead and no successor resumes a stopped fleet. On a hosted fleet, stop only when `lane-host list` has no row but `available`, or name each such host. Run `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/oversee-cycle --state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR] rollup`, which writes the per-class rollup to the fleet log, where the owner reads it against the routes that landed. Report one line per lane in the rows [../references/communication-modes.md](../references/communication-modes.md) § Status report gives: merged SHAs under Landed, still-open PRs and items skipped as owned or blocked under Running, each running lane's `validate_rounds` minutes or `none` under Validation, the queue remainder or `none` under Next, open questions or `none` under Waiting on you. Reapply the § 1 handoff-path check before rewriting the overseer handoff file in place for the next session. The handoff file carries no tmux command: a pane write it hands on names `pane-write`, as Pane paste in [oversee-lanes.md § Talking to a lane](../references/oversee-lanes.md#talking-to-a-lane) gives it. Write each status report given in chat, this one included, to the path `workflow-state progress-report-path` prints as well. At that rewrite, here and at a succession, run the retention [schemas/workflow-state.md § Recording policy](../schemas/workflow-state.md#recording-policy) states. Where it prints a `kept=` line, record that line in the fleet log; its other outputs are [§ Prune](../schemas/workflow-state.md#prune)'s. A succession writes its report as [references/oversee-events.md](../references/oversee-events.md#judgement-rules), Hand off a lane, states and, under a repeat watch, keeps that watch's `[RUN_DIR]`:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state prune --keep [RUN_DIR]
```

Single passes, and Stop, whose watch is already stopped, run `prune` with no `--keep`.
