# Oversee

Standing fleet mode: burn down unblocked work items by launching one orch session per item and shepherding every PR to merge. The overseer launches, watches and unblocks (lanes merge their PRs) — it never reviews, and it implements nothing but a `micro` item § 3 Item Tier leaves it to run. It runs unattended: a blocked lane is the overseer's to unblock, not the user's to notice.

## 1. Resolve The Launch Surface

Once per session, first match wins:

1. `$TMUX` set → tmux lanes: launch each item with `open-terminal` (`handoff.md` § 2), a claude or codex item under § 3 Lane directive.
2. The harness ships session or thread launching (Codex threads, Claude Code agent teams, a desktop app's session tool or bundled skill) → use it: one managed session per item, carrying the same brief `open-terminal` would render.
3. Neither → no parallel surface. Say so once and work the queue sequentially in this session, running each item's § 3 Item Tier brief: `start [ISSUE_ID]`, `small [ISSUE_ID]`, or [micro.md](micro.md) in this session for a `micro` item, with § 2 selection between items. On a hosted fleet this session runs no item: [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § The Cycle, Item work stays in lanes.

A lane's questions arrive at least once as `lane-question` and new tracker items as `triage`, both from the § 4 watch, on every surface. Only session banners are surface-specific: off the tmux surface, read them through the harness's own session tooling.

The owner sends the overseer a note without typing into its pane: `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail send --item overseer --directive --file [PATH]`, run from any checkout of the project (`lane-mail --help`), and the § 4 watch reports it at least once as `owner-note`; a note typed into the chat is acted on the same way. A reply owed to a note is `lane-mail notice --item overseer --to owner --ref [NOTE_ID] --file [PATH]`, so the owner reads it where the note was written. Every question for the owner is an owner ask ([references/communication-modes.md § Owner asks](../references/communication-modes.md#owner-asks)), never a question dialog. A peer repository's overseer writes the same mailbox, reported as `peer-note` ([references/peer-mail.md](../references/peer-mail.md)).

A session a person opened by hand registers itself first, so the hooks and the watch know which session is the overseer: `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/oversee register`. A session `oversee launch` or a succession opened is already recorded.

First in every session, before the handoff file, read that mailbox: `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail inbox --item overseer` prints every note no reader has taken yet and moves the mailbox's own cursor past them. Act on each or record it in the fleet log. The § 4 watch reads through the same cursor, so it does not report them again, save a note it had read before this and not yet acknowledged; a repeated note id is one already seen. What is still owed either way is `lane-mail pending --item overseer` (`lane-mail --help`).

Then read the overseer handoff file the fleet brief names (default `tmp/handoffs/OVERSEER-HANDOFF.md`): the prior session's live lanes, sequence and standing rulings. Absent, start from the tracker; with no item, no handoff file, no note and no owner ask `lane-mail pending --item overseer --to owner` lists, send the [§ Opening question](../references/communication-modes.md#opening-question) with its options and recommendation, and wait for its resolution through § 4; with one listed, wait for that ask's resolution instead. `kendex apply` ignores the default path through `/tmp/`. For a custom path inside a repository, verify before the first read and each write that Git's index has no entry for the file and Git's ignore rules cover the path. If either check fails, stop and report the path. The handoff stays local to the overseer's host, which owns its disk or snapshot persistence, including paths outside a repository. § 5 rewrites it. Then read `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state fleet-log takeover`, the last `ORCH_TAKEOVER_ROWS` fleet log rows other than `cycle` rows, and no other part of the fleet log.

## 2. Select Work

Unblocked, non-terminal items from the tracker, gated exactly as `start.md` gates them (ancestor chain, blocker union, container rules). A GitHub item labeled `blocked` is not a candidate. An item whose `worktree create` exits 75 belongs to another session: skip it; its siblings still launch. On the tmux surface that claim IS `open-terminal`'s own worktree create — never pre-create the worktree. A surface that creates its own worktree environment (Codex app threads) records the claim in workflow-state before launch. Oversee runs as at most one session per repo. `open-terminal --state-dir` enforces `ORCH_OVERSEER_LANES` per fleet and `ORCH_LANE_ACCOUNT_CLAIMS` per account (`--help`). Select no more items than the fleet cap has room for; on other surfaces keep at most that many in flight yourself:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/orch-env ORCH_OVERSEER_LANES 3
```

## 3. Launch

### Item Tier

Every selected item takes a tier before it launches. `item-tier` assigns it, and its `--help` owns the rule:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/item-tier --production [ESTIMATE] --path [LOCATION_PATH] --repo [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]
```

`[ESTIMATE]` is this session's estimate of the production lines the item adds, made from the body read once under § Lane directive step 2. An `**Expected delta**` line is one input to that estimate and never the tier source; `branch-size-check --help` owns that line. Pass one `--path` per file the item's `**Location**` names, and none when it names none. The output line's `brief=` word is the brief § Lane directive mints:

- `micro`: `/orch micro [ISSUE_ID]`, which runs [micro.md](micro.md): no dev subagent, no review cycle, no QA cycle.
- `small`: `/orch small [ISSUE_ID]`, which runs [small.md](small.md): the standard session under thin review bounds.
- `start`: `/orch start [ISSUE_ID]`, the `standard` tier, as the rest of this section states.

A `micro` item launches as a lane like any other, sized under § Lane directive step 2 at the simplest complexity it names, and always with `--cmd`. On a hosted fleet it launches only that way, waiting for a free lane ([SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § The Cycle, Item work stays in lanes). Otherwise, with no lane free, or on the § 1 no-parallel surface, the overseer runs [micro.md](micro.md) in this session from the main checkout; that run holds the checkout on the item's branch until § 3 there returns it to the base, so start it between events and never beside another read of the base checkout.

A run that ends at [micro.md](micro.md) § Escape or [small.md](small.md) § Escape comes back as an item to launch at the next class up, on the branch it left. So does a run that stops without reaching an escape, a failed push or create among the causes. Run `item-tier` again with `--floor` naming the class above the one the run held, and only that when no branch holds a commit past `origin/[BASE_BRANCH]`. Otherwise add `--base origin/[BASE_BRANCH] --head [HEAD_REF] --repo [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]`: `[HEAD_REF]` is `origin/[BRANCH]` once a pushed branch is fetched, else the local `[BRANCH]` every worktree on this host shares. A hosted lane's unpushed branch exists only on its host, so that lane runs the line with its worktree as `--repo`. Read a micro run's § 5 `Checkout` value: a main checkout still on the item's branch is returned to the base before the next launch.

### Lane directive

A launch through `open-terminal` on the tmux surface for the claude or codex harness, whose launcher takes a lane config dir, takes these steps in order, local or on a remote control host. Every other surface or harness launches as § 1 says, with no inventory or pick.

1. Inventory: `lanes list`. On a control host the inventory is that host's login dirs. On a hosted fleet it also carries the provider's own reading of each account it holds a credential for; the `THROUGH` column, `measured_through` under `--json`, says which credential measured each row, and the two readings of one account can disagree.
2. Size: read the item's body once and make a quick judgement of its complexity (a colour, data, docs or bounded one-function fix; a mechanism change across one subsystem; a correctness predicate with several interacting writers or a review already past its round bound), and pick the model and the reasoning effort that complexity needs. Every launch names both. The model is sized BEFORE the lane, because it is what the lane is judged on: an account with plan-wide room can have none left for one model, and choosing the lane first picks an account the launch then opens a usage banner on. Never pick a weaker model because a lane is near its wall: pick another lane.
3. Choose: `lanes pick --harness [HARNESS] --model [MODEL] --json`, naming the model step 2 sized. The threshold is read against the highest usage in the shared 5-hour window, the all-model weekly window, and the named model's scoped weekly window. A shared window can wall every model even when the scoped model window has room. The returned `binding_bucket` names the window that decided. A lane whose windows measure nothing for the model is dropped rather than treated as free. Exit 3 means no lane has room for that model, and nothing launches: [lane-directive.md § No lane has room](../references/lane-directive.md#no-lane-has-room) says what to read, wait on and report. Pass the model in the text the launch runs: inside the `--cmd` command where the launch carries its own harness argv, and in `--launch-flags` where it does not. The launcher records it beside the lane.
4. Launch: the `handoff.md` § 2 `open-terminal` invocation plus `--lane [CONFIG_DIR]` from the picked record, the sized model and effort in the text that launch runs, and `--state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR]` (§ Lane record), one item per launch. A fleet launch carries its brief in `--cmd`, so its model, effort and permission flags go inside that command and never in `--launch-flags`; a launch without `--cmd` puts them in `--launch-flags`. [lane-directive.md § Launch gate](../references/lane-directive.md#launch-gate) holds how `open-terminal` judges the launch and what each refusal licenses.

Launch caps and their refusals: [lane-directive.md § Caps](../references/lane-directive.md#caps).

Placement: before each launch, read `lane-host resolve`; any value but `local` makes a hosted fleet. There every launch this directive makes adds `--host [HOST]`, and any other surface or harness is reported, never launched locally. `start` never launches a hosted lane: only `oversee` and `handoff` launch through `open-terminal --host`. Under [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § The Cycle, Item work stays in lanes, every item launches as a hosted lane through this directive, and a session with no tmux surface reports the queue once, naming that surface as the route. The credential reaches the sandbox per [schemas/lane-host.md](../schemas/lane-host.md) § Provider protocol, with no local `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` prefix.

Per item, mint the brief § Item Tier assigned (or its `github [OWNER/REPO]#[N]` spelling). The brief also carries question routing: "Every question for the overseer goes through `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail` in this worktree, per [skill-rules.md § Coordination](../references/skill-rules.md#coordination): `lane-mail ask --item [ISSUE_ID] --file [PATH]`, then `lane-mail wait` on the printed id. Never use your harness's question tool. Read `lane-mail inbox --item [ISSUE_ID]` at every wait point." A lane whose harness has an Arm in [watch-delivery.md](../references/watch-delivery.md#lane-mailbox-monitor) also gets its brief line. `/orch` slash syntax does nothing in Codex: a Codex CLI lane uses the form open-terminal renders — `Read .agents/skills/orch/SKILL.md and execute the orch start workflow for [ITEM]` — and a Codex Desktop thread uses `$orch start [ITEM]` (`handoff.md` § 2); a pi lane takes `/skill:orch start [ITEM]`, and an opencode lane the `/orch` form. At the `micro` and `small` tiers each of those reads the tier's `brief=` word where it reads `start`. A `micro` or `small` item therefore always launches with `--cmd` carrying its brief: `open-terminal`'s own template renders `start` for every tracker and harness pair it handles, so a launch without `--cmd` runs the standard cycle whatever the tier said. Size launch flags to the item, then launch on the § 1 surface.

A fleet brief can require user authorization for each merge with `ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY=ask`; `auto` stays the default. This setting is merge authorization, not an overseer validation grant. On the tmux surface set it in the overseer's tmux session before the first launch, so every lane window inherits it; on surface 2, pass it in the launcher's environment. The lane's merge question then reaches the overseer as `lane-question` ([oversee-events.md § Held merges](../references/oversee-events.md#judgement-rules)).

```bash
tmux set-environment ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY ask
```

Resolve `ORCH_USER_MODE` once for every question this fleet relays to the user:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/orch-env ORCH_USER_MODE ceo
```

The launch brief identifies the overseer and names `tmp/lane-status-[ISSUE_ID].md` and the mailbox `tmp/lane-mail/[ISSUE_ID]/`, both under the lane's worktree, which its record carries as `mail_root`. It directs the lane to initialize and rewrite the status file with its current step, blocker, handoff paths and validation minutes per round. The file holds at most 40 non-empty lines. The lane follows [skill-rules.md § Coordination](../references/skill-rules.md#coordination) for issue proposals and for every ask. For terminal launches, use `open-terminal --cmd` with the full harness command, and `--state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR]`. A `--cmd` command carries the chosen model, effort and permission flags, the question-tool words, and that brief INSIDE it: the template is rendered verbatim, so `--launch-flags` beside it reach nothing and are refused.

### Recovery relaunch

A dead or walled terminal lane uses native resume, as [lane-directive.md § Recovery relaunch](../references/lane-directive.md#recovery-relaunch) states.

### Lane record

The fleet's record is the oversee workflow state ([schemas/workflow-state.md § Oversee state](../schemas/workflow-state.md#oversee-state)), at one address for the whole session: `[OVERSEE_STATE]` is the file `workflow-state path oversee` prints from the overseer's checkout, which § 4 passes as `--state`, and `[OVERSEE_STATE_DIR]` is the directory it sits in, which every `open-terminal` launch, relaunch and wake passes as `--state-dir`, so a launch run from another repository records into the same fleet and not into that repository's own state.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state path oversee
```

On the tmux surface `open-terminal` creates the state on the first launch and records every lane it launches, relaunches or wakes as one `lanes[]` entry; nothing is written by hand. [lane-directive.md § Tmux session](../references/lane-directive.md#tmux-session) names the tmux session its windows open in. On surface 2 and surface 3 the overseer's first hand-written write creates it: a surface-2 lane record below, or a `fleet_log` or `triaged` append ([oversee-events.md](../references/oversee-events.md)). Before that first write, when `exists` reports false, run `init` (init overwrites: never re-init a live fleet state):

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state exists --json oversee
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state init oversee
```

A record's `item` is the lane's record key, `[ITEM_KEY]` throughout this workflow: the Linear id for a Linear item and `issue-N` for a GitHub item, as `open-terminal` records it and `oversee-watch` names it, never the `[OWNER/REPO]#[N]` the brief spells. On surface 2, whose launcher is the harness's own, append the same record after the launch, with `window` null:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state append oversee lanes '{"item":"[ITEM_KEY]","tracker":"[TRACKER]","repo":"[OWNER/REPO_OR_NULL]","harness":"[HARNESS]","window":null,"account":null,"host":null,"mail_root":"[LANE_WORKTREE]","surface":"[SURFACE]","model":"[MODEL]","session_id":null,"launched_at":"[NOW]","status":"running"}'
```

`[NOW]` is `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`, read before the launch it timestamps and never after, because the first record's `launched_at` is the fleet start that § 4 passes as `--since`:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get oversee '.lanes[0].launched_at'
```

`mail_root` is the lane's worktree path as its own host sees it, and the lane's status file is `[MAIL_ROOT]/tmp/lane-status-[ISSUE_ID].md`. Every later mailbox call for a lane whose record carries `host` runs with `ORCH_LANE_HOST` set to that value and names the root: `lane-mail send --root [MAIL_ROOT] --host`, and `lane-host cat` or `touch`; `lane-close` reads the host from the record. A lane on this host needs neither, and a local lane whose `mail_root` is a worktree of another repository still takes `--root [MAIL_ROOT]`, run from a checkout of that repository: `lane-mail` refuses a cross-repository `send` as `lane-foreign`.

## 4. Watch And Advance

One watch command runs for the whole session, launched and read as § Watch delivery states: repeat mode under the orch job runner, or single passes without `--repeat` where the harness wakes only at a background command's exit. Pass the fleet's start as `--since`. Use the first record's `launched_at`, which stays the same on every pass. Pass `--state [OVERSEE_STATE]` with the file that § 3 Lane record resolves. Before every pass, and before every loop that a quiet pass makes, the watch reads every `lanes[]` record whose status is `running`. It reads the item, its window, and its `mail_root`. It uses the named host for a record that has one. Automatic close uses the directory containing `[OVERSEE_STATE]`; each lane's own workflow-state reads keep their lane-specific location. A lane launch, relaunch, or close while the watch runs needs no watch restart. Each pass prints every event it found as one block in the shape that `oversee-watch --help` states. Handle every line, even when its pass exits nonzero. Fix the cause that stderr names. The next pass starts after the `--repeat` delay. `lane-close` is the only terminal-lane close-out; [lane-reach.md § Lane close](../references/lane-reach.md#lane-close) holds how it ends a lane, what each refusal asks, and each surface's close. A successful dead-overseer or walled-overseer succession makes the single pass exit 3. The repeat command converts that status to 0 and stops because the successor runs its own watch. Notice-only recovery, an exhausted retry, and a blocked recovery that no account in the fleet qualifies for also stop the repeat command with status 0, so a manual replacement starts one new watch and owns the overseer mailbox. Do not restart the old watch after any of those stops. For any other exit, fix the cause that stderr names and start it again. Never hand-roll a monitor. Without the review-gate skill, the watch skips its pr-watch step and `gate-stale` is invisible ([references/gates.md](../references/gates.md) § Multi-PR watching). `LINEAR_TEAM` enables triage. A fleet that tracks work elsewhere runs the same command and gets one stderr notice that triage is off. A repeated pr-watch line becomes context for the next event rather than an event of its own. A pull request in a repository that no `--repo` names is unwatched. Name each repository that the fleet uses, with the item repository first. `merged` and the heartbeat's open pull request list read every repository. The first repository's baseline holds the triage, lane, and merged rows.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-close --state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR] [ITEM_KEY]
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/oversee-watch --repeat 60 --state [OVERSEE_STATE] --interval 240 --since [FLEET_SINCE] --harness [HARNESS] --repo [ITEMS_REPO] --repo [OTHER_REPO]... -- [FLAGS]
```

`[HARNESS]` is the harness this overseer runs, `claude` or `codex`. A Codex pane reports `node`, which names neither, so without it the watch cannot record the launch line before the overseer's first turn end. `[FLAGS]` are the permission flags this overseer runs under, plus its current model and effort flags. Pass all of them even when `ORCH_OVERSEER_PREFERENCE` is set. The watch records this session. A caller, print or walled succession keeps the flags whole except the question-tool words, which a successor carries exactly when `ORCH_QUESTION_TOOL` is off, its default. A named same-harness entry replaces model and effort but keeps the permission words exact. A named cross-harness entry requires one full-bypass mode with an exact equivalent, and no other permission word, and writes the target harness's spelling. Other cross-harness permission modes refuse before launch. The record binds the launch line to the tmux server, pane and window because a dead pane names neither its model nor its account. Start the watch from the overseer's own pane, with `TMUX_PANE` as that pane's shell sets it, and never unset it: a watch with no pane judges no overseer. A record the start cannot build or write, `overseer-line-missing` or `overseer-unrecorded`, is a notice on stderr and in the fleet log, never a stop: the watch still judges the pane, a wall picks its own account, and a death relaunches from the line the fleet state already holds where its record names this pane by server and pane id, the last line a launch, a succession or a watch start recorded for it, which a session restarted by hand in the same pane may not have been started with, and the start's `held=` field names it; a record naming another pane, or none, reports the death with no successor and names that record. A session launched from a stored token names no account in its environment, so its line takes the account the `overseer` record names. Missing permission flags can stop a caller-entry successor at a prompt. Missing model or effort flags can relaunch it with harness defaults. Where the fleet state's `overseer` record names this pane, it supplies the harness and account of that line ahead of `[HARNESS]`, the pane and the environment, and its model and effort as one pair, only where it names a model ([workflow-state.md § Oversee state](../schemas/workflow-state.md#oversee-state)); the flags supply the permission words, and the model and effort where the record names no model.

`oversee-watch --help` states each refusal at start. After a self-succession the successor's own start takes over the watch `oversee-succeed` restarted and first prints what it reported, under `watch-replayed`: handle those lines as events.

**The watch rule.** A turn never ends while the watch is stopped: it alone resolves an owner ask at its deadline, reported as `owner-ask-resolved`. The watch runs two passes on one clock. The mail pass starts every `ORCH_WATCH_MAIL_INTERVAL` seconds (default 20) and reads every mailbox and the lane records, printing what it finds as it finds it. The long pass, holding pr-watch, the merged check, triage and the pane reads, runs every `--interval` seconds; one that overruns holds up no mail pass. A lane's note is read within one mail interval, whatever `--interval` is, save the delays and the overseer-pane hold `oversee-watch --help` names. The mail pass never reads a lane's pane, so it runs on every surface and outside tmux.

### Watch delivery

Launch, follow and re-arm the repeat watch as [references/watch-delivery.md](../references/watch-delivery.md) states.

### Bounded lane reads

Use the pane payload that `oversee-watch` prints as the lane state, and never read the watch log's tail to handle an event: the follow delivers each line once. Each event carries only the lines its own handling reads, taken from below the lane's last user turn and capped by `ORCH_WATCH_TAIL_LINES`, default 12; which lines each kind carries is `oversee-watch --help` § Events. Do not capture the pane again when that payload answers the event. When the payload does not answer it and what you need is the lane's state rather than its text, run `lanes state [WINDOW]`, whose argument is the lane record's `window` as it stands, `SESSION:WINDOW`, and not the `[ITEM]` used elsewhere here, as the `lanes` help says. It prints one of `working`, `idle`, `asking`, `walled`, `exited` or `unjudged` from the same judge the watch and the wake ask, reading the lane's pane as the watch does; [lane-reach.md § Wake refusals](../references/lane-reach.md#wake-refusals) holds how its words differ from a wake's and what each wake refusal licenses. For a fresh status-file read, use `cp` locally or `lane-host cat` after a successful `lane-host touch` probe on a hosted lane. Run one source line, then the shared filter. Run each line in a separate tool call. The redirection keeps a hosted file out of the overseer until the filter emits its last 40 non-empty lines. A failed probe, source read, or filter stops the event. Never read a lane transcript.

```bash
cp -- [STATUS_FILE] tmp/oversee-lane-status-source
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-host cat --item [ISSUE_ID] [STATUS_FILE] > tmp/oversee-lane-status-source
awk 'NF {line[++count]=$0} END {first=count-39; if (first < 1) first=1; for (i=first; i<=count; i++) print line[i]}' tmp/oversee-lane-status-source
```

### Bounded issue reads

For each `triage` or `heartbeat` pass, replace `[AGE]` with an `Nd` value that covers the fleet start and run each code line in a separate tool call. The first line redirects the complete response to ignored scratch storage, so no issue body enters the overseer. The second line is the only issue-list result the overseer reads. It emits each identifier, title, and `## Done when` body. The last line removes the complete response.

```bash
.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh issues list --team [TEAM] --created-since [AGE] --max --format=raw > tmp/oversee-triage-source.json
jq '[.issues.nodes[] | {identifier, title, done_when: ((("\n" + (.description // "")) | gsub("\r\n"; "\n") | split("\n## Done when\n")) as $sections | if ($sections | length) > 1 then ($sections[1] | split("\n## ")[0] | gsub("^[[:space:]]+|[[:space:]]+$"; "")) else "" end)}]' tmp/oversee-triage-source.json
rm -f tmp/oversee-triage-source.json
```

### Parking a merge wait

A hosted lane whose pull request is armed or queued and waiting for the merge queue does nothing but wait, and its sandbox bills for every minute of it. Park it: end the harness and stop the sandbox, keep its disk and record, and let the watch carry the pull request to its merge. `lane-close --park --pr [PR_NUMBER] [ITEM_KEY]` is the whole verb, run with `--state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR]` like every close, and it is the one judge of whether the lane may go: it reads the record's provider, the pull request from GitHub and the review-gate reducer before it signals anything, and refuses as `park-refused` naming the condition it stopped on. The provider is read first, through `lane-host stop-sandbox --check`, which changes nothing: a provider without the `stop-sandbox` and `start` pair answers the absent-verb status, `lane-host-ssh` among them, and the park refuses as `provider-unsupported` with no GitHub call and no signal, so on such a fleet the verb ends no lane. Then the pull request: it refuses when the pull request is not open, is not the item's branch, is neither in the merge queue nor auto-merge armed, or, armed and outside the queue, reads any `mergeStateStatus` but `CLEAN`, GitHub's word for every required check green on the current head and nothing else blocking; a queued pull request is admitted on the queue's own admission, since GitHub queues nothing before every required check is green on its head, and its arm has converted to the queue entry by then, so `autoMergeRequest` reads null for the whole wait. Last the reducer, `pr-watch.sh` as `OVERSEE_WATCH_PR_WATCH` names it: an attention line refuses, and its silence is the gate met, no thread open and the arm or queue entry standing. A lane inside a CI or gate wait after a push meets one of those and is never parked; run the verb, never a reading of your own. The provider's `stop-sandbox` follows the harness stop and the window kill, and only its `sandbox-stopped` line records the lane `parked`, with `{pr, head, repo, at}`; a stop the provider refuses leaves the record `stopped`, `--keep-sandbox`'s truthful state, under `park-failed`, and a plain Recovery relaunch or a second `--park` recovers it (`lane-close --help`).

When to run it: at a `heartbeat` pass, for each hosted `running` lane whose open pull request the pass's open-PR list names and whose reducer lines name nothing, once the lane's status file (§ Bounded lane reads) puts it in `merge-pr.md` § 5 step 1's queue wait. Those open-PR lines carry repo, number, branch and title and no arm or queue state: the verb's own read is the only judge of queued or armed and `CLEAN`, and its refusal is the answer where the lane is not ready. What a refusal costs: on a provider without the pair, the check alone and no GitHub call, so one run says the fleet parks nothing; at GitHub's own state, the check, one `gh pr view` and one queue read, plus a `gh repo view` for a record naming no repository; only a pull request that reads queued, or armed and `CLEAN`, reaches the reducer, which reads its threads and gate.

What a parked lane keeps: its record, its `mail_root` and PR-watch rows, and its disk, with the harness transcript, the mailbox and its `tmp`. What it gives up: its window, its pane reads and its mail pass, since the disk is stopped, and its working-lane slot, since `open-terminal` counts `running` and `preparing` records alone against `ORCH_OVERSEER_LANES` ([lane-directive.md § Caps](../references/lane-directive.md#caps)). The § 4 watch carries a parked record for its merged check alone and names the count as `parked=` in its `fleet-read` note; `oversee-report` lists it under Running with the pull request its record names and reads nothing from its disk.

What ends a park, each per [oversee-events.md § Event kinds](../references/oversee-events.md#event-kinds):

- `merged` of the pull request the parked record names, in that repository: the watch closes the sandbox in that pass through `lane-close`, without starting it, and reports `lane-closed` or `lane-close-refused`; nothing wakes the lane, and another pull request merged on the branch's name is reported and closes nothing. The lane's own `merge-pr.md` § 5 steps 2-6 never run, so the overseer owes them: the tracker completion and container close of step 2, the base sync of step 3 as the `merged` event already runs it, and the late-thread answers of step 5, each as that event states. Once step 2's tracker completion has run, close the item out of the overseer's state directory with `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state --state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR] remove [ITEM_KEY]`, the removal the parked close skipped as `item-files-kept cause=open` because the tracker still held the item open when the watch closed the sandbox; the lane's own workflow state and lock were on the sandbox disk and went with it under the provider close. The cycle record that event runs first reads the lane's rounds as `rounds-unread` by construction, the lane's own state being on the disk the park stopped.
- A `pr-watch` line on the parked pull request, `threads-open`, `changes-requested`, `disarmed`, `head-moved`, `untracked-claim`, `unreasoned-decline`, `suppressed-findings`, `gate-stale` or `error`: the lane is needed again. `disarmed` is also how a dequeue nothing else reported reads, since the reducer prints it for a pull request neither queued nor armed with its gate open, so the queue needs no other reading, and a parked pull request the heartbeat still lists open with no reducer line stays parked. Resume it through [lane-directive.md § Recovery relaunch](../references/lane-directive.md#recovery-relaunch): the launcher starts the sandbox first, rewrites the record `stopped` once the provider confirms the start, and resumes the harness on its kept disk; a start the provider does not confirm is `host-start-failed` with the record still parked, never a resumed lane, and a create that fails after the start leaves the stopped record, which a plain relaunch recovers. A resumed lane that opens on no transcript to continue is a blocker to report, not a resume.

### Talking to a lane

Answering and directing are the same two commands on every harness and every surface, inside tmux or not. Add `--root [MAIL_ROOT] --host` for a lane whose record puts it on another host, and `--root [MAIL_ROOT]` alone, run from a checkout of that repository, for a local lane whose `mail_root` is another repository's worktree.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail send --item [ISSUE_ID] --re [MESSAGE_ID] --file [PATH]
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail send --item [ISSUE_ID] --directive --file [PATH]
```

Text crosses `--file` ([SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § Harness-Safe Shell). A directive answers no ask and `--halt` in place of `--directive` halts the lane; the Lane mail rule in [skill-rules.md](../references/skill-rules.md) says when each reaches it. Wake the lane after the send where [watch-delivery.md](../references/watch-delivery.md#lane-mailbox-monitor) says. Keep the lane's tracker, repository, harness, item, `--lane` and `--launch-flags` arguments. The wake resumes the lane's own session with one line that runs `lane-mail inbox`, and reaches only lanes on this host, run from the checkout the send used, because the wake resolves the lane's tree from the caller's own project; it wakes a lane only when the shared judge calls it `idle`, and refuses any other state as `wake-refused reason=[STATE]`. Never send a lane text by keystroke.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/open-terminal --wake --harness [HARNESS] --state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR] [ISSUE_ID]
```

After a directive, wait for the watch's `directive-read` for its id: the lane's own mailbox cursor passing it, whichever read path moved it, on every harness and on a hosted lane. Never read a pane to confirm a delivery. `directive-unread` is the directive still unread past `ORCH_DIRECTIVE_UNREAD_SECS`: wake the lane, reach it by Pane paste, or relaunch it, by the lane's state and [lane-reach.md](../references/lane-reach.md).

**A refusal is a state, not a remedy.** A halt or an answer to a lane with no monitor that the wake refuses lands only where the Lane mail rule above says. Send where the reason allows it; mail that cannot wait takes [lane-reach.md](../references/lane-reach.md#mail-the-wake-cannot-deliver).

[references/lane-reach.md](../references/lane-reach.md) holds what each wake refusal reason licenses and, per harness, how a lane is launched, how its state is read and how its harness dialogs are answered.

**Pane paste.** Write harness input to a file with the harness file tool, then type it with the one pane writer. `[WINDOW]` is the lane record's `window`, and `[PROCESS]` is the record's `harness`, or `ssh` for a record carrying `host`:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/pane-write --window [WINDOW] --expect [PROCESS] --file [PATH]
```

It cancels copy mode, pastes the file and presses `Enter`. A dialog key takes `--key [KEY]` in place of `--file`. A refusal, exit 1, types nothing, and its `fix=` line names the remedy (`pane-write --help`). Exit 2, `write-failed`, may have typed part of the input: read the pane before a retry. Never paste a shell command into a lane pane. Stop a process inside a hosted sandbox through `lane-host stop --item [ITEM] --harness [HARNESS]`. Never type a process-name kill at a prompt that can belong to the control host.

A lane under a session limit still needs its one-line continuation nudge pasted into its pane at the reset through Pane paste above, since a walled harness runs no turn and so reads no mail; the launch brief and a harness dialog's answer reach a pane the same way, and nothing else does.

A lane never arms the shared git hooks from its worktree; a guard-script PR whose new chain refuses the branch under main's installed scripts is a one-time transition the overseer sequences.

**Resuming a dead or walled lane.** Use [lane-directive.md § Recovery relaunch](../references/lane-directive.md#recovery-relaunch), which resumes the item's newest session natively per `open-terminal --help` § `--relaunch`; a hosted lane has no local transcript lookup. The resumed command carries the continuation line that re-arms the lane's waiters, so the relaunch is the whole step, except on a hosted codex lane, which that section says resumes without the line and takes it by Pane paste afterwards.

## 5. Stop

Queue empty, or the user stops it. A queue empty under a standing `idle` ruling from the [§ Opening question](../references/communication-modes.md#opening-question) is not Stop: the watch keeps running, and the owner's later write arrives through it as an owner note. Stop a detached repeat watch first, as [references/watch-delivery.md](../references/watch-delivery.md) states, then end the follow, so no pass reports this overseer dead and no successor resumes a stopped fleet. On a hosted fleet, stop only when `lane-host list` has no row but `available`, or name each such host. Run `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/oversee-cycle --state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR] rollup`, which writes the per-class rollup to the fleet log, where the owner reads it against the routes that landed. Report one line per lane in the rows [../references/communication-modes.md](../references/communication-modes.md) § Status report gives: merged SHAs under Landed, still-open PRs and items skipped as owned or blocked under Running, each running lane's `validate_rounds` minutes or `none` under Validation, the queue remainder or `none` under Next, open questions or `none` under Waiting on you. Reapply the § 1 handoff-path check before rewriting the overseer handoff file in place for the next session. The handoff file carries no tmux command: a pane write it hands on names `pane-write`, as Pane paste in § Talking to a lane gives it. Write each status report given in chat, this one included, to the path `workflow-state progress-report-path` prints as well. At that rewrite, here and at a succession, run the retention [schemas/workflow-state.md § Recording policy](../schemas/workflow-state.md#recording-policy) states. Where it prints a `kept=` line, record that line in the fleet log; its other outputs are [§ Prune](../schemas/workflow-state.md#prune)'s. A succession writes its report as [references/oversee-events.md](../references/oversee-events.md#judgement-rules), Hand off a lane, states and, under a repeat watch, keeps that watch's `[RUN_DIR]`:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state prune --keep [RUN_DIR]
```

Single passes, and Stop, whose watch is already stopped, run `prune` with no `--keep`.
