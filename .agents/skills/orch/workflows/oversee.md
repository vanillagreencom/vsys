# Oversee

Standing fleet mode: burn down unblocked work items by launching one orch session per item and shepherding every PR to merge. The overseer launches, watches, unblocks, and merges — it never implements or reviews. It runs unattended: a blocked lane is the overseer's to unblock, not the user's to notice.

## 1. Resolve The Launch Surface

Once per session, first match wins:

1. `$TMUX` set → tmux lanes: launch each item with `open-terminal` (`handoff.md` § 2), a claude or codex item under § 3 Lane directive.
2. The harness ships session or thread launching (Codex threads, Claude Code agent teams, a desktop app's session tool or bundled skill) → use it: one managed session per item, carrying the same brief `open-terminal` would render.
3. Neither → no parallel surface. Say so once and work the queue sequentially in this session: `start [ISSUE_ID]` per item, § 2 selection between items.

A lane's questions arrive as `lane-question` and new tracker items as `triage`, both from the § 4 watch, on every surface. Only session banners are surface-specific: off the tmux surface, read them through the harness's own session tooling.

The owner sends the overseer a note without typing into its pane: `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail send --item overseer --directive --file [PATH]`, run from any checkout of the project (`lane-mail --help`), and the § 4 watch reports it once as `owner-note`. A peer repository's overseer writes the same mailbox, reported as `peer-note` ([references/peer-mail.md](../references/peer-mail.md)).

Then read the overseer handoff file the fleet brief names (default `tmp/handoffs/OVERSEER-HANDOFF.md`): the prior session's live lanes, sequence and standing rulings. Absent, start from the tracker. `kendex apply` ignores the default path through `/tmp/`. For a custom path inside a repository, verify before the first read and each write that Git's index has no entry for the file and Git's ignore rules cover the path. If either check fails, stop and report the path. The handoff stays local to the overseer's host, which owns its disk or snapshot persistence, including paths outside a repository. § 5 rewrites it.

## 2. Select Work

Unblocked, non-terminal items from the tracker, gated exactly as `start.md` gates them (ancestor chain, blocker union, container rules). A GitHub item labeled `blocked` is not a candidate. An item whose `worktree create` exits 75 belongs to another session: skip it; its siblings still launch. On the tmux surface that claim IS `open-terminal`'s own worktree create — never pre-create the worktree. A surface that creates its own worktree environment (Codex app threads) records the claim in workflow-state before launch. Oversee runs as at most one session per repo. Read the lane cap and keep at most that many items in flight:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/orch-env ORCH_OVERSEER_LANES 3
```

## 3. Launch

### Lane directive

A launch through `open-terminal` on the tmux surface for the claude or codex harness, whose launcher takes a lane config dir, takes these steps in order, local or on a remote control host. Every other surface or harness launches as § 1 says, with no inventory or pick.

1. Inventory: `lanes list`. On a control host the inventory is that host's login dirs.
2. Size: read the item's body once and make a quick judgement of its complexity (a colour, data, docs or bounded one-function fix; a mechanism change across one subsystem; a correctness predicate with several interacting writers or a review already past its round bound), and pick the model that complexity needs. The model is sized BEFORE the lane, because it is what the lane is judged on: an account with plan-wide room can have none left for one model, and choosing the lane first picks an account the launch then opens a usage banner on. Never pick a weaker model because a lane is near its wall: pick another lane.
3. Choose: `lanes pick --harness [HARNESS] --model [MODEL] --json`, naming the model step 2 sized. The threshold is then read against the window that walls that model rather than the account's most-consumed one, and a lane whose windows measure nothing for it is dropped rather than treated as free. Exit 3 means no lane has room for that model, and nothing launches: read `lanes list`, wait only when its lanes are over the threshold, and report every `expired`, `unreachable`, `no_credentials`, `no_usage_data` or `error` lane to the operator. An `expired` lane is one whose token renewal failed; its `detail` names why. Every Claude account `expired` for a missing OAuth client id needs `ORCH_LANES_CLAUDE_CLIENT_ID`, set once per host. Pass the model in `--launch-flags`; the launcher records it beside the lane.
4. Launch: the `handoff.md` § 2 `open-terminal` invocation plus `--lane [CONFIG_DIR]` from the picked record, the sized `--launch-flags` and `--state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR]` (§ Lane record), one item per launch. `open-terminal` reads the model out of those flags and judges the named lane on it a second time, so a lane picked without `--model` can be refused here. The gate emits three refusals, each with its own answer:
   - `lane-model-walled` (naming `lane`, `model`, `pct` and `max-pct`): that account's window for the model is at or above the threshold. Re-run step 3 with `--model`, never retry the same lane.
   - `lane-model-unreadable`: no window of that account measures the model, or its usage could not be read at all. An unread window is never an empty one, so the answer is the same re-pick.
   - `lane-judge-failed`: the judge refused before it answered, a malformed `--lane-max-pct` among the causes. The keyed `lanes:` line above it names which.

   An unreadable in-flight claim store is not a refusal here: this gate asks for a wall, which no claim count enters, so `lanes` reports the store on stderr as `pick-lane-claims` and answers the wall anyway. Fix the claims directory, or set `OVERSEE_WATCH_STATE_DIR`, so the next `lanes pick` across the fleet can still see what is running.

Placement: before each launch, read `lane-host resolve`; any value but `local` makes a hosted fleet. There every launch this directive makes adds `--host [HOST]`, and any other surface or harness is reported, never launched locally. `start` never launches a hosted lane: only `oversee` and `handoff` launch through `open-terminal --host`, so `/orch start [ISSUE_ID]` on a control host runs the item in that session. The credential reaches the sandbox per [schemas/lane-host.md](../schemas/lane-host.md) § Provider protocol, with no local `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` prefix.

Per item, mint the brief `/orch start [ISSUE_ID]` (or `/orch start github [OWNER/REPO]#[N]`). The brief also carries question routing: "Every question for the overseer goes through `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail` in this worktree, per [skill-rules.md § Coordination](../references/skill-rules.md#coordination): `lane-mail ask --item [ISSUE_ID] --file [PATH]`, then `lane-mail wait` on the printed id. Never use your harness's question tool. Read `lane-mail inbox --item [ISSUE_ID]` at every wait point." `/orch` slash syntax does nothing in Codex: a Codex CLI lane uses the form open-terminal renders — `Read .agents/skills/orch/SKILL.md and execute the orch start workflow for [ITEM]` — and a Codex Desktop thread uses `$orch start [ITEM]` (`handoff.md` § 2). Size launch flags to the item, then launch on the § 1 surface.

A fleet brief can require user authorization for each merge with `ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY=ask`; `auto` stays the default. This setting is merge authorization, not an overseer validation grant. On the tmux surface set it in the overseer's tmux session before the first launch, so every lane window inherits it; on surface 2, pass it in the launcher's environment. The lane's merge question then reaches the overseer as `lane-question` ([oversee-events.md § Held merges](../references/oversee-events.md#judgement-rules)).

```bash
tmux set-environment ORCH_MERGE_AUTONOMY ask
```

The launch brief identifies the overseer and names `tmp/lane-status-[ISSUE_ID].md` and the mailbox `tmp/lane-mail/[ISSUE_ID]/`, both under the lane's worktree, which its record carries as `mail_root`. It directs the lane to initialize and rewrite the status file with its current step, blocker, and handoff paths. The file holds at most 40 non-empty lines. The lane follows [skill-rules.md § Coordination](../references/skill-rules.md#coordination) for issue proposals and for every ask. For terminal launches, use `open-terminal --cmd` with the full harness command, chosen launch flags, that brief, and `--state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR]`.

### Recovery relaunch

A dead or walled terminal lane uses native resume. Start with the `handoff.md` § 2 terminal command. Add `--relaunch`, the selected `--lane`, the chosen `--launch-flags` and `--state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR]`. Keep the tracker, repository, harness, and item arguments. Do not pass `--cmd`, because a custom command bypasses session lookup. A record carrying `host` adds `--host [HOST]`: the provider keeps its tree and the harness continues natively. The launcher delivers the continuation line in the resumed command itself and keeps a merged item's tree as it stands, so nothing is pasted into the pane after the resume. A hosted codex lane is the exception: `codex resume` refuses a prompt beside `--last`, so it resumes with no line and the launcher reports `resume-lineless`. Paste that lane's continuation line into its pane through § Talking to a lane, Pane paste, the way a walled lane gets its nudge.

### Lane record

The fleet's record is the oversee workflow state ([schemas/workflow-state.md § Oversee state](../schemas/workflow-state.md#oversee-state)), at one address for the whole session: `[OVERSEE_STATE]` is the file `workflow-state path oversee` prints from the overseer's checkout, which § 4 passes as `--state`, and `[OVERSEE_STATE_DIR]` is the directory it sits in, which every `open-terminal` launch, relaunch and wake passes as `--state-dir`, so a launch run from another repository (the proposal sweep) records into the same fleet and not into that repository's own state.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state path oversee
```

On the tmux surface `open-terminal` creates the state on the first launch and records every lane it launches, relaunches or wakes as one `lanes[]` entry; nothing is written by hand. On surface 2 and surface 3 the overseer's first hand-written write creates it: a surface-2 lane record below, or a `fleet_log` or `triaged` append ([oversee-events.md](../references/oversee-events.md)). Before that first write, when `exists` reports false, run `init` (init overwrites: never re-init a live fleet state):

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state exists --json oversee
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state init oversee
```

A record's `item` is the lane's record key, `[ITEM_KEY]` throughout this workflow: the Linear id for a Linear item and `issue-N` for a GitHub item, as `open-terminal` records it and `oversee-watch` names it, never the `[OWNER/REPO]#[N]` the brief spells. On surface 2, whose launcher is the harness's own, append the same record after the launch, with `window` null:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state append oversee lanes '{"item":"[ITEM_KEY]","window":null,"account":null,"host":null,"mail_root":"[LANE_WORKTREE]","surface":"[SURFACE]","model":"[MODEL]","session_id":null,"launched_at":"[NOW]","status":"running"}'
```

`[NOW]` is `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`, read before the launch it timestamps and never after, because the first record's `launched_at` is the fleet start that § 4 passes as `--since`:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get oversee '.lanes[0].launched_at'
```

`mail_root` is the lane's worktree path as its own host sees it, and the lane's status file is `[MAIL_ROOT]/tmp/lane-status-[ISSUE_ID].md`. Every later call for a lane whose record carries `host` runs with `ORCH_LANE_HOST` set to that value and names the root: `lane-mail send --root [MAIL_ROOT] --host`, `lane-host cat`, `touch` and `close`; a lane on this host needs neither, and a local lane whose `mail_root` is a worktree of another repository (the proposal sweep) still takes `--root [MAIL_ROOT]`, run from a checkout of that repository: `lane-mail` refuses a cross-repository `send` as `lane-foreign`.

## 4. Watch And Advance

One repeat-mode command watches for the whole session, passed the fleet's start as `--since` (the first record's `launched_at` — the same value on every pass, never "now"), `--repo` for every repository the fleet has PRs in, and `--state [OVERSEE_STATE]`, the file § 3 Lane record resolves. Before every pass the watch reads every `lanes[]` record whose status is `running`: the item, its window where the record has one, and its `mail_root` as the root its mailbox is read under, through the host where the record carries `host`, so a lane launched, relaunched or closed between passes needs no restart. Each pass prints every event it found as one block, in the shape `oversee-watch --help` states, so no kind starves another — handle every line. An `EVENT` line on stdout is handled even when its pass exits non-zero: handle it and fix what stderr names; the next pass starts after the `--repeat` delay. The command does not exit on its own: run it in the background for the session and read its output as it arrives. A merged local item and a dead lane leave the watch when their record's status is set to `done` by the update below, keyed by `[ITEM_KEY]` as § 3 Lane record states it; the update fails and writes nothing when no record names that key, so a mistyped key is never reported as a close-out. A merged hosted item keeps its record `running` until the watch reports `lane-closed` or `lane-close-refused` for it. When the watch exits, fix what stderr names and start it again. Never hand-roll a monitor. Without the review-gate skill the watch skips its pr-watch step and `gate-stale` is invisible ([references/gates.md](../references/gates.md) § Multi-PR watching); `LINEAR_TEAM` arms triage, so a fleet on a repo tracking its work elsewhere runs the same command and is told once on stderr that triage is off; a repeated pr-watch line is context appended to the next event rather than an event of its own (`oversee-watch --help`). A PR in a repo no `--repo` names is unwatched, so a fleet shepherding work into consumer repos names each of them, the repo holding the items FIRST: `merged` and the heartbeat's open-PR list read every one, each line naming its repo, and the first one's baseline holds the triage, lane and merged rows.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state update oversee 'if any(.lanes[]; .item == "[ITEM_KEY]") then (.lanes[] | select(.item == "[ITEM_KEY]") | .status) = "done" else error("no lane record names [ITEM_KEY]") end'
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/oversee-watch --repeat 60 --state [OVERSEE_STATE] --interval 240 --since [FLEET_SINCE] --repo [ITEMS_REPO] --repo [OTHER_REPO]...
```

The mail pass reads each lane's mailbox, never a pane, so it runs on every surface and outside tmux.

### Bounded lane reads

Use the pane tail that `oversee-watch` prints as the lane state. It already contains at most the last 40 non-empty lines. Do not capture the pane again when that tail answers the event. When the tail does not answer it and what you need is the lane's state rather than its text, run `lanes state [WINDOW]`, whose argument is the lane's tmux window name and not the `[ITEM]` used elsewhere here: the tracker id `TEAM-N` on the Linear route, `gh-N` on the GitHub route, as the `lanes` help says. It prints one of `working`, `idle`, `asking`, `walled`, `exited` or `unjudged` from the same judge the watch and the wake ask, reading the lane's pane as the watch does. `unjudged` means the pane settled nothing, not that a wake would be refused: the wake reads the harness process as well, so it can still answer where this cannot. `idle` is likewise the pane's word alone: the wake also reads the harness process, and it refuses a lane whose process reads busy. A live Codex lane is refused every time, because codex publishes no idle signal: as `working` where its process has a shell under it, and as `unjudged` otherwise. A harness process another user owns, root among them, answers `unjudged` for the whole lane while it runs, and on a host with no `/proc` the wake's process read answers `unjudged` for any lane whose harness has a process on the box. None of that reaches this verb, which makes no process read: its own `unjudged` is the pane's silence, and the refusal table under § Talking to a lane keeps the two apart under one row each. What a wake refusal licenses is that table. For a fresh status-file read, use `cp` locally or `lane-host cat` after a successful `lane-host touch` probe on a hosted lane. Run one source line, then the shared filter. Run each line in a separate tool call. The redirection keeps a hosted file out of the overseer until the filter emits its last 40 non-empty lines. A failed probe, source read, or filter stops the event. Never read a lane transcript.

```bash
cp -- [STATUS_FILE] tmp/oversee-lane-status-source
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-host cat --item [ISSUE_ID] [STATUS_FILE] > tmp/oversee-lane-status-source
awk 'NF {line[++count]=$0} END {first=count-39; if (first < 1) first=1; for (i=first; i<=count; i++) print line[i]}' tmp/oversee-lane-status-source
```

### Bounded issue reads

For each `triage` or `heartbeat` pass, replace `[AGE]` with an `Nd` value that covers the fleet start and run each code line in a separate tool call. The first line redirects the complete response to ignored scratch storage, so no issue body enters the overseer. The second line is the only issue-list result the overseer reads. It emits each identifier, title, and `## Done when` body. The last line removes the complete response.

```bash
.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh issues list --team [TEAM] --created-since [AGE] --max --format=raw > tmp/oversee-triage-source.json
jq '[.issues.nodes[] | {identifier, title, done_when: ((("\n" + (.description // "")) | gsub("\r\n"; "\n") | split("\n## Done when\n")) as $sections | if ($sections | length) > 1 then ($sections[1] | split("\n## ")[0] | gsub("^[[:space:]]+|[[:space:]]+$"; "")) else "" end)}]' tmp/oversee-triage-source.json
rm -f tmp/oversee-triage-source.json
```

### Judgement at every event

- Judgement rules for every event: [oversee-events.md § Judgement rules](../references/oversee-events.md#judgement-rules).
- Handling per event kind: [oversee-events.md § Event kinds](../references/oversee-events.md#event-kinds).

### Talking to a lane

Answering and directing are the same two commands on every harness and every surface, inside tmux or not. Add `--root [MAIL_ROOT] --host` for a lane whose record puts it on another host, and `--root [MAIL_ROOT]` alone, run from a checkout of that repository, for a local lane whose `mail_root` is another repository's worktree.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail send --item [ISSUE_ID] --re [MESSAGE_ID] --file [PATH]
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail send --item [ISSUE_ID] --directive --file [PATH]
```

Text crosses `--file` ([SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § Harness-Safe Shell). A directive answers no ask and `--halt` in place of `--directive` halts the lane; the Lane mail rule in [skill-rules.md](../references/skill-rules.md) says when each reaches it, so wake the lane after the send. Keep the lane's tracker, repository, harness, item, `--lane` and `--launch-flags` arguments. The wake resumes the lane's own session with one line that runs `lane-mail inbox`, and reaches only lanes on this host, run from a checkout of the lane's own repository when its `mail_root` is another repository's worktree, because the wake resolves the lane's tree from the caller's own project; it wakes a lane only when the shared judge calls it `idle`, and refuses any other state as `wake-refused reason=[STATE]`. The table below says what each reason licenses. Never send a lane text by keystroke.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/open-terminal --wake --harness [HARNESS] --state-dir [OVERSEE_STATE_DIR] [ISSUE_ID]
```

**A refusal is a state, not a remedy.** Mail reaches a lane only through the hooks the Lane mail rule in [skill-rules.md](../references/skill-rules.md) names, so a halt or an answer lands only while the lane still takes a tool call or ends a turn. Send where the reason allows it, then reach the lane at its pane by the paste below when the refusal does not clear, or relaunch it under § Recovery relaunch. The rows are the wake's refusal reasons, plus the different silence `lanes state` reports under the same word. A Pi wake goes to the live session through pi-bridge and is never put to the judge, so no row refuses one.

| Reason | What the judge read | How the lane is reached |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| `working` | A turn in flight, or a pane that cannot be read as anything else: a frame scrolled up its own history reads `working` while it stays there, and so does a lane streaming its last message. | Send, and a lane still taking tool calls reads it at the next one. Scroll the pane back to the bottom and read the state again; a refusal that stays is reached at the pane. |
| `asking` | A dialog is waiting on an answer. | Answer it by the harness column of the table below, not by mail. |
| `walled` | The account is spent and the turn is over. | Reads no mail. Reach it at the pane, or relaunch after the reset its banner names. |
| `exited` | Nothing is running under the pane. | Reads no mail. Relaunch it. |
| `unjudged` from a wake | The process read gave no positive idle: a live Codex process, a harness process another user owns, a host with no `/proc` carrying a process named for that harness, or a limit-banner scan that failed. | The turn may already have ended, so mail may never arrive. Reach it at the pane. |
| `unjudged` from `lanes state` | No process is read at all. The pane settled nothing: no pane on this server carries the name, because the window closed or two windows share it, or the pane's screen carries no marker. | A closed window is relaunched under § Recovery relaunch. For a shared name, find the lane's own window before touching either: `tmux list-panes -a -F '#{window_name} #{pane_id} #{pane_current_path}'` prints both with their working directories, and the lane's is the one sitting in its worktree. Rename the other, with `tmux rename-window`. Renaming the lane's own leaves the name on no pane, which the next watch pass reads as `window-gone` and relaunches the item beside its live session, so make the check first. A markerless screen is read at the pane. |

What stays per harness is launching, resuming and the harness's own dialogs; the Pi commands are the pi-session-bridge CLI, documented in its [README](https://github.com/vanillagreencom/kendex/blob/main/pi-extensions/pi-session-bridge/README.md) and `pi-bridge --help`, and every Pi call selects the lane by `--name` or `--cwd`.

**Pane paste.** Write the text to a file with the harness file tool. Run `tmux load-buffer <file>`, then `tmux paste-buffer -p -d -t <pane>`. Before each `Enter`, read `tmux display-message -p -t <pane> '#{pane_in_mode}'`. If it prints `1`, run `tmux send-keys -t <pane> -X cancel` and read the mode again. Send `tmux send-keys -t <pane> Enter` only when the mode reads `0`.

| Harness | Launch | Read state | Answer a harness dialog |
|---------|--------|------------|-------------------------|
| Claude Code | `open-terminal` into a tmux pane (§ 3). In a tmux pane, a first launch in a folder the wrapper has not trusted shows a trust prompt with "No, exit" selected: `Down`, `Enter`, then relaunch. | Follow § Bounded lane reads. | Move the dialog with the arrow keys and press `Enter` in the lane's pane; the recorded choice line confirms it. The rm-safety prompt ("Dangerous rm operation on possibly-empty variable path") fires even under bypass: read the command, and `Enter` on Yes when it stays inside the lane's own worktree. |
| Codex | `open-terminal` into a tmux pane (§ 3). | Follow § Bounded lane reads. | Type the number the dialog shows into the lane's pane, at the idle prompt. |
| Pi | `open-terminal` into a tmux pane (§ 3). | Follow § Bounded lane reads. Use `pi-bridge state` only when the event has no lane tail; never use `history` or `stream`. `pi-bridge questions` lists a pending dialog with its request id. | `pi-bridge answer` on the selected lane with that request id and the option label, never the pane: a typed number lands on the default option. |
| App or other | The session or thread launcher the harness or an app-specific skill exposes (§ 1). | Use its API or tooling to read only the bounded state that explains the event. | The API or tooling that surface exposes; a pane at its idle prompt only when nothing else exists. |

A lane under a session limit still needs its one-line continuation nudge pasted into its pane at the reset through Pane paste above, since a walled harness runs no turn and so reads no mail; the launch brief and a harness dialog's answer reach a pane the same way, and nothing else does.

A lane never arms the shared git hooks from its worktree; a guard-script PR whose new chain refuses the branch under main's installed scripts is a one-time transition the overseer sequences.

**Resuming a dead or walled lane.** Use § 3 Recovery relaunch, which resumes the item's newest session natively per `open-terminal --help` § `--relaunch`; a hosted lane has no local transcript lookup. The resumed command carries the continuation line that re-arms the lane's waiters, so the relaunch is the whole step, except on a hosted codex lane, which § 3 says resumes without the line and takes it by Pane paste afterwards.

## 5. Stop

Queue empty, or the user stops it. On a hosted fleet, stop only when `lane-host list` has no row but `available`, or name each such host. Report one line per lane: merged SHAs, still-open PRs, items skipped as owned or blocked. Reapply the § 1 handoff-path check before rewriting the overseer handoff file in place for the next session, and delete stale per-session handoff files beside it at that rewrite, never leave them.
