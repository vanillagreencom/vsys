# PR Comment Triage Workflow

Route PR review comments to domain agents, fix the valid ones, reply to and resolve every thread.

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `review-pr-comments` | Full triage: analyze, fix, create issues, reply |
| `review-pr-comments [PR-number]` \| `[BRANCH_NAME]` | A specific PR |
| `review-pr-comments --dry-run [N]` | §§ 1-5 only: triage report, no side effects |
| (from submit-pr) | Managed lifecycle with caller context |

**Caller context** (via `⤵`): `worktree`; `lifecycle` — `"managed"` (return at § 8) or `"self"` (default); `issue_id` — the workflow-state key, the normalized issue ID, never the bare GitHub issue number; `pr_number`.

Resolve `ORCH_DECISION_MODE` once for this post-PR workflow:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/orch-env ORCH_DECISION_MODE auto-recommended
```

**Standalone init** (`lifecycle: "self"`): `gh pr view --json number -q .number` gives `PR_NUMBER`, and `git-context issue-from-branch .` gives `ISSUE_ID` when the branch carries an issue id. When it does not, `ISSUE_ID` is `pr-[PR_NUMBER]`, the same repository-local fallback key [`ci-fix.md` § 1](ci-fix.md) and [`merge-pr.md` § 3](merge-pr.md) use; a branch with no issue id is ordinary, not a stop. Then, when `workflow-state exists --json [ISSUE_ID]` reports false, resolve `WT_PATH`, read the branch with `git-context branch`, and run `workflow-state init [ISSUE_ID] --worktree [WT_PATH] --branch [BRANCH]`, since the round-start prune reads the worktree from state.

Both commands below write to that state, so the key must resolve and the state must exist before either runs. Except under `--dry-run`, this triage pass is a continuing action:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state update [ISSUE_ID] '.post_pr_stop = null'
```

On any `gh` or `github.sh` failure, report the error. `auto-recommended` retries once and logs `Retry`; a repeated failure records the named stop `github-read-failed` per [SKILL.md § The Cycle](../SKILL.md#the-cycle). `ask` presents `Retry` | `Skip step` | `Abort`, with `Retry` recommended.

## 1. Fetch And Parse

Triage what exists on the PR. The one bounded bot wait is [Copilot work in flight on the current head](../references/copilot-wait.md): run it before the `pr-data` read below. Other bots do not hold this read. Bot prose is never a gate: emoji reactions, sticky comments, and checklist text carry no gating weight.

```bash
.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh pr-data "[PR_NUMBER]"
```

The JSON carries `threads` (inline) and `comments` (PR-level). It is read without `--actionable`, which drops outdated threads: [submit-pr.md](submit-pr.md) § 3 and [thread-read.md](../references/thread-read.md) count them with `pr-threads --unresolved`, so each one needs a reply and a resolve here.

**Baseline for re-runs.** Find the prior summary comment this run's GitHub identity posted, a person or a GitHub App installation alike, and use its `updated_at` as `SUMMARY_TS`; `{}` means no prior summary, so there is no `SUMMARY_TS`:

```bash
.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh find-comment [PR_NUMBER] --pattern "Recommendations.*Processed" --self
```

**Filter.** From PR-level `comments`, exclude noise bots (`dependabot`, `github-actions`, `renovate`, `codecov`, tracker sync bots; a match ignores a trailing `[bot]`, which pr-data's logins lack), anything created before `SUMMARY_TS` on a re-run, and status updates with no actionable content. From `threads`, exclude resolved threads only: every unresolved inline thread, whatever its author and outdated ones included, gets a § 6.3 reply and resolve, and a noise-bot thread gets `Declined: [REASON]`. Keep every reviewer comment — human or bot — on such a thread.

**Bot review summaries.** Derive bot logins from the authors present in the data (anything ending in `[bot]`) and fetch each one's summary comment, one command per bot with the literal login:

```bash
.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh find-comment [PR_NUMBER] --author "[BOT_LOGIN]" --review-summary
```

`--review-summary` picks, in order: the "View job" sticky, the review-section comment, then that bot's earliest comment. No bot having posted yet → continue with the human and inline comments that exist.

**Extract** per item: `thread_id`/`comment_id`, `author`, `body`, `path`, `line`, `url`, and `source` (`inline` or `pr-level`). Bot review summaries additionally get a `section` and a keyword-derived source type — architectural, documentation, security, testing, performance, or plain suggestion — plus `blocking: true` for security items and `false` when the text says non-blocking or optional. Skip anything the bot labels an inline comment: those are already captured as review threads, with the bot username as `author`. Never filter bot inline threads out.

**Issue context.** `issue_id` from the caller, else the `ISSUE_ID` the standalone init above resolved, which falls back to `pr-[PR_NUMBER]` and so always has a value. Resolve `WT_PATH` as `git-context repo-root "[DIR]"`, `[DIR]` being `worktree exists`/`worktree path` when they match and `.` otherwise.

Fill `Worktree:` from `git -C "[DIR]" rev-parse --show-toplevel`.

Then gather decisions:

```bash
.agents/skills/decider/scripts/decisions search --issue [ISSUE_ID]
.agents/skills/decider/scripts/decisions search "[KEYWORDS_OF_THE_CHANGED_AREA]"
```

The `path` fields in that JSON are the ONLY authorized source for decision file paths — never compose or recall one from memory. A decision binds only after its full record and status are read: one marked superseded binds only what its status leaves active, and a retired one binds nothing. Verify each before injecting it, one command per path:

```bash
test -f [DECISION_FILE_PATH]
```

A failed check omits the path and carries `decision index lookup failed for [DECISION_ID]` instead.

## 2. Detect Domains

Map each comment to a domain from its source type and file path. Domain-to-agent routing is project-configurable: the source types above name their own reviewer domain, a path maps through the project's component conventions, `docs/**` goes to the documentation reviewer, and a comment with no file path goes to the architecture reviewer.

## 3. Analyze

Apply [Delegation](../references/skill-rules.md#delegation) before selecting domain, architecture, or fix agents on every pass. Delegate to the mapped domain agents in parallel.

<delegation_format>
Analyze these PR review comments for your domain.

PR: #[PR_NUMBER] - [TITLE]
Parent Issue: [ISSUE_ID]
Worktree: [WORKTREE_PATH]

Decision context (read before classifying — do NOT suggest changes that contradict these):
[For each verified decision: "[DECISION_ID]: [ONE_LINE_SUMMARY] — [DECISION_FILE_PATH]"]
[For each decision whose path failed verification: "decision index lookup failed for [DECISION_ID]"]
[If none: "No linked decisions found."]

Comments for your review:
[For each comment:]
---
Source ID: [THREAD_ID, COMMENT_ID or file:line]
Source Type: [inline, pr-level or review-body]
Author: @[AUTHOR]
File: [PATH]:[LINE] (or "general" if no file)
Comment: "[BODY]"
Blocking: [true/false]
URL: [URL]
---

1. Read `.agents/skills/orch/references/finding-disposition.md` and apply its verification prerequisite and decision flow to every finding — read the actual source files before classifying any comment.
2. Classify into arrays per `../../reviewer/schemas/review-finding.md`:
   - `blockers[]`: verified and blocking, or P1/P2
   - `suggestions[]`: verified, non-blocking
   - `questions[]`: QUESTION type — include a draft response. For review-body inputs, use `Declined: [VERIFIED_DECISION_FLOW_REASON]`, answering the non-defect claim.
   - Noise or failed checks from other sources: omit.
   - Every review-body input must remain in one array, including false claims, Step 0 exclusions, vague or informational items, and other verified declines. Keep these in `questions[]`: copy the original claim into `question` and put `Declined: [VERIFIED_DECISION_FLOW_REASON]` in `draft_response`. Use the existing Question Fields; this is a reply carrier, not a fix item or a question to the user.
   - Already fixed: do NOT omit silently. Return it in `questions[]` with `outcome: "already_fixed"`, `commit: "[SHA]"`, and a `draft_response`.
3. Preserve `source_id` and `source_type` from the input on every item. This report boundary owns disposition retention: no filter or omission rule removes a review-body input or its verified reply reason.
4. Write the JSON to `[WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/review-[AGENT]-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` with your harness file-write tool — never shell redirection, a heredoc, `tee`, or `echo >`.
5. Return exactly:

   <output_format>
   Report: [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/review-[AGENT]-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json
   Verdict: [pass|action_required]
   </output_format>
</delegation_format>

Collect each agent's report path for § 5.

## 4. Synthesize

**Skip if** the comments came from a single domain.

Delegate to the architecture reviewer with the domain report paths, asking for cross-cutting findings only: issues spanning domains, dependencies between suggestions (`dependency: #A blocks #B (reason)`), gaps at domain boundaries, and conflicts between domain recommendations (flag both, resolve neither). It must not modify or overrule domain findings — only add its own, in the same JSON schema at `[WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/review-arch-synthesis-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json`, returning the same `Report:`/`Verdict:` pair. Add the returned path to the set.

## 5. Triage Report

Read every report and aggregate across agents preserving attribution. Keep every review-body item with its source identity and verified reply draft through § 6.3; do not deduplicate it away. Deduplicate other items by (location, description), keeping the first and noting all sources. `blockers[]` and `category: "fix"` suggestions are fix items; `category: "issue"` suggestions defer to § 6.2; `questions[]` are auto-answered in § 7, except review-body items, which § 6.3 dispositions. Show verified body declines in SKIPPING with their draft reason. These reply-only items never enter the fix set.

**Recurrence before the cap.** A finding sharing a root cause with one a prior pass patched is dispositioned by [finding-disposition.md § Recurrence](../references/finding-disposition.md#recurrence), which allows `structural-close` or `freeze` and no further patch round. Check it here, ahead of § 6.1's round cap. Read both records with the command that section states, before any item below is dispositioned. A finding sharing a cause in `patched_causes` is the recurrence this rule ends, and one sharing a cause in `frozen_causes` is `declined` without re-triaging.

Auto-fix every valid item — do not prompt for a selection. Skip an item only when it contradicts an active decision (cite the decision id), is too vague to act on, is out of the PR's scope (→ issue), carries a root cause § Recurrence dispositions (→ `RECURRENCE`, never an auto-fix), or cannot affect real usage (decline with one line, per [SKILL.md § The Cycle](../SKILL.md#the-cycle)).

Omit empty sections and proceed straight to § 6 — no user prompt.

## 6. Apply Fixes And Loop

The `fix set` is every § 5 row marked Fixing plus every `structural-close` row: a structural close IS a fix round, one whose item names the generating surface rather than the site, and cutting surface the Done-when does not require is a close. `freeze` and `declined` rows are `reply-only` — they never join the delegation, the commit, or the push.

**Every pass owes both of these before it answers a thread** — fix-only, reply-only, mixed, `freeze`, `declined` alike. The subsections below run in the order they appear and the single `reply step` is the last of them, so a pass reading straight through owes nothing it has not already done:

1. Every class issue a reply names exists. § 6.2 files each `freeze` row's class issue; a `declined` row names the issue its frozen cause carries.
2. Every cause a reply closes is recorded — a `freeze` row's in `frozen_causes`, an applied item's in `patched_causes`. A cause the store does not carry is one the next pass re-triages in place of declining it. Write the file its shape below names, then bind the path.

```json
{"cause": "[ONE_LINE]", "issue": "[CLASS_ISSUE_ID]"}
{"cause": "[ONE_LINE]", "commit": "[COMMIT_SHA]"}
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state append-file [ISSUE_ID] pr_comment_review.frozen_causes [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/frozen-cause-[ISSUE_ID].json
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state append-file [ISSUE_ID] pr_comment_review.patched_causes [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/patched-cause-[ISSUE_ID].json
```

### 6.1 Delegate Fixes

**Skip the delegation and the push if** the `fix set` is empty; the pass still owes every thread its answer at the `reply step` below.

Read the round budget first. The cap governs what may be pushed, so it decides before the fix round, never after one:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state cap REVIEW_MAX_EXTERNAL_ROUNDS --issue [ISSUE_ID]
```

It prints `below [COUNT]/[CAP]` or `at-cap [COUNT]/[CAP]`, counting `pr_comment_review.iterations`. An `at-cap` verdict on `REVIEW_MAX_EXTERNAL_ROUNDS` ends the ordinary fix rounds on this PR. Two rules decide the pass. **At the cap the disposition is unconditional and the fix is what stops**: every thread is analyzed and gets its reply posted and resolved, on this pass and every later one, and what the cap forbids is the fix and the push that follows it. The **fix set** is what the rest of this section groups, records and delegates: the items marked Fixing, and **at the cap only the cap-exempt ones — a defect this diff itself introduces or arms and Step 0 does not exclude**. The pass then runs three steps, in order. **File first** — run § 6.2 for every item clearing its bar, invoked with its return recorded as `→ § 6.1` rather than § 6.2's usual `→ § 6.3`. **Then the exception**, the only fix delegation and the only push this pass makes; a fix the verification pass below triggers is part of it. **Then reply**, through the reply table below: `Tracked: [ISSUE_ID]` for a filed item, `Fixed in [SHA]` for one the exception fixed, `Declined: [REASON]` for the rest, which needs no issue. Resolve each thread as you reply, then → § 6.3 with § 6.2 already done.

**Delegate the fix set.** Ensure the worktree exists (`worktree exists`/`worktree path`, creating with `--pr [PR_NUMBER]` when missing) and record the head the verification pass below diffs against, once per fix set:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state set-git-head [ISSUE_ID] pre_delegate_sha [WORKTREE_PATH]
```

Group the `fix set` by `agent`. Before stamping each group's round, read the target PR and bind `[PR_OPEN]` by [dev-fix.md § 2](dev-fix.md#2-delegate) step 4:

```bash
env -u GH_REPO -u GITHUB_REPOSITORY .agents/skills/orch/scripts/pr-view-json [WORKTREE_PATH] [PR_NUMBER] --json state
```

Then stamp the round as separate tool calls immediately before delegating. Apply the cleanup condition and arm the watchdog per [references/skill-rules.md § Round Closure](../references/skill-rules.md#round-closure):

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state new-round-id [ISSUE_ID] dev_round_id
```

Apply [Round Closure](../references/skill-rules.md#round-closure)'s cleanup condition to this helper call:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/round-prune [ISSUE_ID]
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state set-now [ISSUE_ID] dev_delegated_at
```

Persist this group's slice of the `fix set`: write `[WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/dev-round-items-[DEV_ROUND_ID].json` with the harness file-write tool as a JSON array of `{"n": [N], "text": "[ITEM_TEXT]", "reach": "[REACH]"}`. `[ITEM_TEXT]` is that item's formatted block from the delegation verbatim. `[REACH]` names the shipped producer, user action, or fixture that reaches the finding — a command a person runs, a file a shipped writer emits, a test in the tree. An item with no reach is a `Declined:` reply, not a fix: disposition it per [`../references/finding-disposition.md` § Filing bar](../references/finding-disposition.md#filing-bar) instead of delegating it. The writer refuses a short list of shapes, enumerated in [`../schemas/dev-round.md`](../schemas/dev-round.md) and in `dev-round-write --help`; it is a backstop and not the judgement — a reach it accepts has been recorded, not approved.

Decide whether this fix round may add protected files. [`../schemas/dev-round.md` § Protected additions](../schemas/dev-round.md#protected-additions) is the sole scope definition. The default is none.

When the list is non-empty, pass those exact repository-relative paths to the writer as one blank-separated `--adds` value, and render the same list after `Adds:` in the delegation — one path is `Adds: tools/one-helper.sh`, several are `Adds: tools/one-helper.sh skills/x/scripts/check`. A blank or tab separates, so a path containing whitespace is read as two paths and cannot be authorized as one — check for that before you write the line.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/dev-round-write --worktree [WORKTREE_PATH] --issue [ISSUE_ID] --round-id [DEV_ROUND_ID] --items-file [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/dev-round-items-[DEV_ROUND_ID].json --source pr-comments --pr-open [PR_OPEN] [--adds "[REPO_RELATIVE_PATHS]"]
```

A chosen cut follows [`dev-fix.md` § 2](dev-fix.md) step 4 with `[SOURCE]` bound to `pr-comments`. A nonzero exit names a usage or environment failure. Report it and stop.

⚠ Fill placeholders only ([Format Tags Are Literal](../references/skill-rules.md#format-tags-are-literal)). `Recommendation:` is the technical fix; the agent owns its own process.

Read the near-ceiling lines the last recorded round left, and render one `Near-ceiling:` line per entry. The key is the one carrier: the artifact's own path is addressed by `dev_round_id`, which the stamp above has already overwritten.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '.near_ceiling // []'
```

Fill `Worktree:` from `git -C "[DIR]" rev-parse --show-toplevel`, and `Labels:` as [dev-fix.md § 2](dev-fix.md#2-delegate) fills it.

**Accept the round** on **A** (the round-scoped artifact) and **B** (git completion), never the return message:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '.dev_round_id // empty'
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/dev-artifact-check --worktree [WORKTREE_PATH] --issue [ISSUE_ID] --round-id [DEV_ROUND_ID_FROM_PREVIOUS_COMMAND] --expect-items-from-round
```

```bash
git -C "[WORKTREE_PATH]" status --porcelain
git -C "[WORKTREE_PATH]" log -1 --oneline
```

Apply the fix-round acceptance in [`dev-fix.md` § 2](dev-fix.md), which is canonical: the stalled-round route stated ahead of its A×B table, then the table itself, including exact-commit binding on accept, the bounded git re-read on `accept` with B failing, the report-only tail-reconciliation nudge on `wait` with B passing, and the never-accept `retry` row, which never re-runs the fix. On accept: applied items are marked for reply, items the agent skipped go to the skipped list with their reason, and blocked items become issue candidates in § 6.2.

**Verify before the push.** Every accepted fix round gets one focused pass over its diff, `[PRE_SHA]...HEAD`, by [review-pr.md § Bounded Re-Review](review-pr.md#bounded-re-review)'s rule for a fix diff no reviewer has seen, whatever `REVIEW_MAX_EXTERNAL_ROUNDS` reads. Its panel is that section's scoped panel over this diff: the reviewers whose domains it touches, and the domain reviewers § 2 routed the applied items to, whose defect classes the round fixed. A panel holding every `first_panel` reviewer carries that section's `domain_reasons`, or `workflow-state` refuses it as `panel-copy`:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state set [ISSUE_ID] verification_panel '{"agents": [PANEL_AGENTS_JSON], "reason": "pr-comments fix round: [DOMAINS]"}'
```

Delegate and collect it as review-pr.md § 2.2 and § 3 do, with `Diff-range: [PRE_SHA]...HEAD`, then shut its reviewers down and clear their state with review-pr.md § 5's first write. Its blockers and `category == "fix"` suggestions re-enter § 5's disposition flow as findings of this pass; what survives joins this pass's `fix set` as a defect this diff introduces. Its `category == "issue"` suggestions go to § 6.2, as § 5 routes the triage reports' own; at the cap, where § 6.2 has already run, it runs once more for them after this pass. One verification pass runs per push: the fix it triggers joins the same push without a second pass, and the next external round reviews it.

**Batch per fully-reviewed head.** Push a fix round only after every configured reviewer has reported on the current head. A pass with nothing to push skips this command:

Before every push, run `env -u GH_REPO -u GITHUB_REPOSITORY .agents/skills/orch/scripts/pr-view-json "[WORKTREE_PATH]" --json number,state,autoMergeRequest` and record whether `autoMergeRequest` is armed; after § 6.3 has no new threads and §§ 7–8 finish, an armed standalone triage enters [merge-pr.md](merge-pr.md) from its entry point, while an armed managed triage returns that recorded decision with its § 8 result so the caller's merge stage owns the canonical lifecycle.

```bash
git -C "[WORKTREE_PATH]" push origin HEAD
```

With workflow state `pr_order` reading `open-first-returned`, publish through `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/worktree-push --worktree "[WORKTREE_PATH]" --issue [ISSUE_ID]` in place of that command, routing its exit code and `sha-reconcile:` line by `worktree-push --help`, so [submit-pr.md](submit-pr.md) § 2 step 1 pushes next and GitHub receives one combined head. That push may rebase this round's fix commits, whose SHAs come from the dev return and sit in no record it rewrites: resolve each through workflow state's `.rebase_map`, following the chain until no key matches, before § 6.3's `Fixed in` reply and § 8's `pr_comment_review.fixes` entry use it, and a chain ending in `dropped` puts no SHA in the reply and the `dropped:[COMMIT_SHA]` marker in the entry.

**A round ends with the description matching its head.** The PR body describes the commits actually on the PR head and names every issue § 6.2 filed this round; nothing else regenerates it after round one, so rebuild it per [`submit-pr.md` § 2](submit-pr.md) step 3 and post it with `pr-edit-body` until both hold.

### 6.2 Create Issues

**Skip if** nothing clears the filing bar in [references/finding-disposition.md](../references/finding-disposition.md). Blocked items, skipped items, `category: "issue"` suggestions, and each `freeze` row's class issue that clear it go into an audit-input file at `[WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/audit-pr-comments-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` per `.agents/skills/project-management/schemas/audit-issues-input.md`, with `source: "pr-comments"` and `tracker.type` set to the resolved `TRACKER` (plus `tracker.repository` for GitHub items), then apply [skill-rules.md § Coordination](../references/skill-rules.md#coordination) before `⤵ .agents/skills/project-management/workflows/audit-issues.md --issues [FILE_PATH] § 1-9 → § 6.3`.

### 6.3 Re-Triage Or Exit

**Reply step.** Reply to and resolve every inline thread this pass handled, never deferring one to § 7. For `source_type: "review-body"`, collect § 6.3's replies for every retained report item in one `Dispositions at [BODY_REVIEW_HEAD]` PR comment. Use the full source-reviewed SHA § 7.2 saved in this pass's context. This publication owner keeps that marker unchanged across any body or thread fix push, including a rebase. A reconciled fix SHA belongs in reply text and never replaces the marker. This rule applies to every outcome below, including mixed passes. Open each line with its original `source_id` (`file:line`), per `check-review-replies --help`. Post it with `post-comment --body-file`; record each item in `pr_comment_review.replied` with its `source_id` and `source_type`. These items use neither `post-reply` nor `resolve-thread`; continue to this section's single `iterations` increment.

| Outcome | Reply body |
|---------|------------|
| Applied | `Fixed in [COMMIT_SHA]: [SHORT_FIX_SUMMARY]` |
| Skipped, blocked, or declined, nothing filed | `Declined: [REASON]` |
| Blocked or skipped → issue | `Tracked: [CREATED_ISSUE_ID]` |
| Already fixed | Review-body: `Fixed in [COMMIT_SHA]: [SHORT_FIX_SUMMARY]`, using its verified fix SHA; otherwise the finding's `draft_response` |
| Question or verified decline | Review-body: its retained `draft_response`, in `Declined: [VERIFIED_DECISION_FLOW_REASON]` form; otherwise the finding's `draft_response` |

A `Tracked:` reply names the issue it filed, and a decline is a decline — say so. Resolving a thread is not a reply.

`[REASON]` takes one of the forms [../references/finding-disposition.md](../references/finding-disposition.md) § Decision flow sets out.

Write `[REPLY_BODY]` with the harness file-write tool to `tmp/pr-reply-[THREAD_ID].md` and bind that path as `[BODY_FILE]`.

```bash
.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh post-reply "[THREAD_ID]" --body-file [BODY_FILE] --pr "[PR_NUMBER]"
```

```bash
.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh resolve-thread "[THREAD_ID]"
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state append [ISSUE_ID] pr_comment_review.replied '{"source_id":"[THREAD_ID]","commit":"[COMMIT_SHA]","outcome":"[applied|skipped|blocked|already_fixed]"}'
```

PR-level comments and human-only threads stay deferred to § 7.

This section counts the round and decides whether to loop; the cap is § 6.1's and is not re-applied here. Run [the bounded current-head Copilot wait](../references/copilot-wait.md) before the `pr-data` read below. This is the one exception to checking once without waiting for bots to re-review. Then check for comments that arrived while fixes were being applied and loop or exit.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state increment [ISSUE_ID] pr_comment_review.iterations
```

This is the only writer of `pr_comment_review.iterations` in any workflow: one triage pass advances the counter by exactly one, and a caller that runs this workflow writes neither it nor § 8's result arrays.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '{known: (.pr_review_baseline.last_threads // [])}'
```

```bash
.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh pr-threads [PR_NUMBER] --unresolved
```

A thread is new when its `threads[].id` is not in `known`. No new threads → § 7. Otherwise update the baseline and loop to § 1, at the cap as below it: the next pass analyzes the new threads and posts their dispositions, and § 6.1 is where the fix and the push stop:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state set [ISSUE_ID] pr_review_baseline '{"last_threads":[UNRESOLVED_THREAD_IDS]}'
```

## 7. Replies And Final Summary

### 7.1 Post Remaining Replies

**Backstop only** — inline threads handled per-pass in § 6.3 are already replied to and resolved. This covers PR-level comments, human-only threads, and anything per-pass handling missed. Skip any `source_id` already in `pr_comment_review.replied`.

Review-body items, including `questions[]` and `already_fixed`, stay in § 6.3's head-bound disposition comment and never use this plain-reply path. Other reply bodies are § 6.3's table, which is where the `questions[]` § 5 routes here are answered — the Question row, the finding's own `draft_response`. Such a question is not a finding, so it takes no disposition and its answer is never a `Declined:`. Two clauses this step adds: a skip that contradicts a recorded decision spells its `[REASON]` as `contradicts [DECISION_ID]`, and an issue named by `Tracked:` exists before the reply is posted.

Write every reply body with the harness file-write tool to `tmp/pr-reply-[SOURCE_ID].md` and bind that path as `[BODY_FILE]`. Use `post-reply --body-file [BODY_FILE]` for threads and `post-comment --body-file [BODY_FILE]` for PR-level comments. Number lists `1.` `2.` `3.`, never `#N`.

**Contested bot reviews.** When a domain agent classifies a bot's blocking comment as noise: tag the bot with the reason and a re-review request, dismiss its `CHANGES_REQUESTED` with `github.sh dismiss-review [PR_NUMBER] --bot --message "[REASON]"`, and resolve the thread. Tag a human reviewer the same way, but never dismiss their review.

Auto-resolve every thread where a reply was posted; keep open only threads awaiting a human response.

### 7.2 Copilot Head Route

Run [the current-head Copilot wait](../references/copilot-wait.md) before the body check, any review request or any head notice in this step. Keep `[COPILOT_WAIT]` for the head routing below. Skip this wait when `pr_order` reads `open-first-returned`, as the step's skip rule directs.

**Skip if** workflow state `pr_order` reads `open-first-returned`, with no notice and no request: on a PR [start-worktree.md](start-worktree.md) § 2.1 opened, the lane's `Review:` line still reads pending, and [submit-pr.md](submit-pr.md) § 2 step 1 routes the head once its push lands. Copilot's review overview opens with one of three labels. It submits `Approved` as an `APPROVED` review. It submits `Changes recommended` and `Needs a closer look` as `COMMENTED`. It re-reads a head only on a review request, so a head its review left `COMMENTED` stays unapproved after the answers until one of the two routes below runs. Bind `[REVIEW_BASE_CHECKOUT]` per [Gate-mode routing](../references/gates.md#gate-mode-routing). Resolve through that consumer base:

```bash
env -u GH_REPO -u GITHUB_REPOSITORY .agents/skills/orch/scripts/approval-wait [PR_NUMBER] --resolve-mode --base-checkout [REVIEW_BASE_CHECKOUT]
```

A non-zero exit is no mode: report it and end this step. In both `off` and `approval`, bind the head before any approval-only exit:

```bash
env -u GH_REPO -u GITHUB_REPOSITORY gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid
```

A non-zero exit, which is reported, ends this step. If this head differs from `[COPILOT_WAIT]`'s head, restart the current-head wait. Otherwise read every review of the pull request, oldest first, one id, login, `commit_id`, `state` and body per line:

```bash
env -u GH_REPO -u GITHUB_REPOSITORY gh api --paginate 'repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/[PR_NUMBER]/reviews' --jq '.[] | [.id, .user.login, .commit_id, .state, .body] | @tsv'
```

**Body findings.** Copilot writes a finding on code the diff left unchanged only in its review body, under `Previously missed` or `Suppressed comments`, and no thread carries it. An `APPROVED` review can carry them too. After binding the head and reviews, before any approval-only exit or route selection, and again before a `copilot-approved-on-rerequest`, `copilot-declined-unchanged` or `copilot-fallback` notice, run the one reader of those bodies, so a body finding is answered before the lane waits on CI rather than at the merge gate after it:

```bash
env -u GH_REPO -u GITHUB_REPOSITORY .agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh -C "[WORKTREE_PATH]" check-review-replies [PR_NUMBER]
```

A `head=` other than `[HEAD_SHA]` restarts this § 7.2 from its current-head wait and head/reviews reads. On exit `1` with `suppressed-entry` lines, save `[HEAD_SHA]` as `[BODY_REVIEW_HEAD]` in the new pass's context before looping to § 2. Carry that saved head with each entry's original source identity through analysis, reporting and publication; later head reads and fix pushes never replace it. Each entry is an item: `source_type: "review-body"`, `source_id: "[file:line]"`, and the finding's text from the review at `[BODY_REVIEW_HEAD]` in the reviews read above. This pass uses §§ 5–6, including Recurrence before the cap, the fix set, verification and cause records; § 6.3 posts its body replies and counts the pass once. After § 6.3 completes that pass, restart this § 7.2 from its current-head wait, head/reviews reads and route selection, including the body check again. The pushed head's body findings enter their own pass with that head saved as its source. Keep handled body items with their source-reviewed heads for the skip decision and notices. Complete § 8 before returning to the caller with the current head and whether the pass pushed; discard every route selected before the pass. Other exit `1` rules use the reply rewrite in [submit-pr.md § 6.1 Merge Gates](submit-pr.md#61-merge-gates). Under the thread lines of a `copilot-declined-unchanged` or `copilot-fallback` notice, one line per body finding gives its `path:line` and the answering comment's URL, and one line names the id of each Copilot review at `[HEAD_SHA]` from the reviews read. No notice goes out, and no step ends on an approved head, before an exit `0`. Exit `2` reached no verdict: report its first stderr line and send nothing.

`off` ends this step only after the body check exits `0`, per [Gate-mode routing](../references/gates.md#gate-mode-routing). On `approval`, skip the remaining approval routing only if neither a thread nor a review-body item this triage handled is Copilot's and the body check exits `0`.

A line whose `commit_id` is `[HEAD_SHA]` and whose `state` is `APPROVED` ends this step after the body check's exit `0`: the head is already approved. Every Copilot thread is answered and resolved by now. The route is whether the head moved since the `commit_id` of the last `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]` line, the last head Copilot read:

- **Head unmoved.** Copilot read this head, so each answer stands on code it saw. Send the notice below, first line `copilot-declined-unchanged PR #[PR_NUMBER] head [HEAD_SHA]`. Under it, one line per thread `github.sh pr-threads [PR_NUMBER]` lists with `author` `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` gives its `id`, its location and the reply that answered it, a decline's reason included. Request no Copilot re-review. The overseer approves the head under [copilot-head-notices.md](../references/copilot-head-notices.md).
- **Head moved**, by a push for any reviewer's thread or body finding. If `[COPILOT_WAIT]` names `[HEAD_SHA]` with a `run` other than `none`, that in-flight run counts as the request: record the head below, send no second request, and start the existing approval wait. Otherwise, unless the head already equals `pr_approval.copilot_rerequest_head`, request one Copilot re-review, record that head, then wait on it through [Waiter launch](../references/waiter-launch.md). A head already recorded with no work observed gets no second request, no wait and no notice: the overseer's `awaiting-stale` rule decides it.

  Only the route that needs a new request runs this command:

  ```bash
  env -u GH_REPO -u GITHUB_REPOSITORY .agents/skills/orch/scripts/approval-wait [PR_NUMBER] --request-review --base-checkout [REVIEW_BASE_CHECKOUT]
  ```

  For a new request, route the answer per [Copilot requests](../references/gates.md#copilot-requests) before recording the head or starting the wait. On `fallback`, record the head and start no wait. Under `cause=refused`, send the notice `copilot-fallback PR #[PR_NUMBER] head [HEAD_SHA] [CAUSE]`, `[CAUSE]` and the line under it as that section sets, which asks for the overseer's fallback approval; under `cause=off` send nothing, since the caller's approval wait sends it.

  ```bash
  .agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state update [ISSUE_ID] '.pr_approval.copilot_rerequest_head = "[HEAD_SHA]"'
  ```

  ```bash
  env -u GH_REPO -u GITHUB_REPOSITORY .agents/skills/orch/scripts/approval-wait [PR_NUMBER] 30 --json --mode approval --on-timeout block --item [ISSUE_ID] --base-checkout [REVIEW_BASE_CHECKOUT]
  ```

  Exit `5` with the log line `<waiter>: mail=<count>` or `<waiter>: mail-unreadable=<path>` is no verdict: run `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail inbox --item [ISSUE_ID]`, act on what it prints, then launch the wait again. On any other answer, bind the head again; if it changed, restart this § 7.2 from its current-head wait. Otherwise read the reviews again. A `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]` line whose `commit_id` is `[HEAD_SHA]` is the re-review, since none existed when the request went out:

  | Answer | Copilot's review at `[HEAD_SHA]` | Then |
  |--------|----------------------------------|------|
  | `comments` | any | Update the baseline and loop to § 1 for the new thread as § 6.3 does; this section then routes the head again |
  | `approved` | `APPROVED` | Run the body check above; on its exit `0`, notice `copilot-approved-on-rerequest PR #[PR_NUMBER] head [HEAD_SHA]` |
  | `approved` | none or not `APPROVED` | No notice: another reviewer approved the head |
  | `copilot-error` | error answer | Route as [Copilot requests](../references/gates.md#copilot-requests) says. The caller keeps the approval gate unmet and waits for the overseer approval |
  | `timeout` | present, not `APPROVED` | Copilot read the head again and left no open thread. Notice `copilot-fallback PR #[PR_NUMBER] head [HEAD_SHA]`, which asks for the overseer's fallback approval |
  | `timeout` | none | No notice: the overseer's `awaiting-stale` rule decides the head |
  | any other | any | No notice: the caller's own approval wait routes it |

**Notice.** In a lane, write it with the harness file-write tool to `[WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/copilot-head-[ISSUE_ID].md` and send it with `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail notice --item [ISSUE_ID] --file [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/copilot-head-[ISSUE_ID].md`. Outside a lane no overseer reads a notice, and the caller's own approval wait decides the head.

</output_format>

`auto-recommended` logs `Continue`, clears any stop, and goes to § 8 without a question, while `ask` stops here and a managed run returns the pending choice to its caller rather than continuing because its lifecycle is managed.

A request to fix a skipped item delegates that single item via § 6.1, pushes, and returns here. Confirmation clears any stop and goes to § 8.

**Standalone only**: post the cumulative summary as a PR comment when there were fixes or created issues, written to a file first, and on the Linear issue too when `TRACKER` is `linear`.

```markdown
## Recommendations Processed

### Fixed in PR
- [SOURCE]: [ITEM] — [SHA]

### Issues Created
- [ISSUE_ID] - [TITLE] — [PROJECT]

### Not Addressed
- [SOURCE]: [ITEM] — [REASON]
```

## 8. Update State And Return

One tool call per block — each append runs per item. A fix and a skip entry carry the finding's own text, so each is written to a file with the harness file-write tool and bound by path:

```json
{"description": "[DESC]", "location": "[LOC]", "commit": "[SHA]", "source": "[SOURCE]"}
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state append-file [ISSUE_ID] pr_comment_review.fixes [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/state-fix-[ISSUE_ID].json
```

```json
{"description": "[DESC]", "reason": "[REASON]"}
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state append-file [ISSUE_ID] pr_comment_review.skipped [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/state-skipped-[ISSUE_ID].json
```

An issue id is not finding text and stays inline:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state append [ISSUE_ID] pr_comment_review.issues_created "[CREATED_ISSUE_ID]"
```

**Managed**: return to the parent workflow's next section. **Standalone**: return `.post_pr_stop` when present; otherwise the triage session is complete.
