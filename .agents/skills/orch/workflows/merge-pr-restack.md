# Merge-pr restack cycle

Use this cycle for a `conflicting` queue-wait verdict, and for a `worktree-push-base-conflict` refusal that [submit-pr.md](submit-pr.md) § 2 step 1 routes here: steps 1-3, and step 4 returns to that step instead of `merge-pr.md`. [§ Unarm at a stop](#unarm-at-a-stop) runs step 1 alone, to unarm a PR, and pushes or restacks nothing. A base conflict is not a CI failure.

1. Unarm the PR before any push. If live `autoMergeRequest` is set, disable auto-merge first. If `isInMergeQueue` remains true, read the PR node id with `gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json id`, call GraphQL `dequeuePullRequest`, then re-read both fields. Either still set means hand back without pushing. This order prevents an armed PR from re-entering the queue while it is dequeued.

2. Resolve the managed worktree, then ask whether a fix round is in flight before rebasing anything:

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree path [ISSUE]
   ```

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/orch/scripts/worktree-push --check-live-round --worktree [WT_PATH] --issue [ISSUE]
   ```

   It pushes nothing. Exit 0 is the only answer that permits the restack; any other exit hands back, and the command says which it was (`worktree-push --help`). `worktree create [ISSUE] --reuse` rebases outside this check too, and carries no live-round refusal of its own.

   The restack takes [SKILL.md § The Cycle](../SKILL.md#the-cycle), Rules reload after a rebase. Then start the guarded restack:

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree create [ISSUE] --restack
   ```

   No issue worktree means hand back. On conflicts, resolve every listed file, stage it, and run `worktree restack continue [ISSUE]` until complete. Never force-push over an unresolved base.

   Then validate the restacked head before step 3 pushes it. Where a run is made, the head that leaves step 3 is always a head a passing run recorded, or one the skip check below matched to a passing run, and step 3 holds that across its push. Bind the base branch the restack rebased onto as `[BASE_BRANCH]`, and read the mode a range run in the worktree records:

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/orch/scripts/resolve-base-branch [WT_PATH]
   ```

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/orch/scripts/dev-validate-run --resolve-mode --worktree [WT_PATH]
   ```

   A non-zero exit from `resolve-base-branch`, `--resolve-mode`, or the `--record` read below hands back with that command's stderr and pushes nothing.

   `validate-mode=full` means the project sets no `DEV_VALIDATE_RANGE_CMD`: go to step 3 with no run. `validate-mode=range` first asks whether the last passing run in the worktree already validated the restacked head:

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/orch/scripts/restack-skip --worktree [WT_PATH] --base origin/[BASE_BRANCH]
   ```

   Exit 0 prints `restack=skip condition=[CONDITION] ... head=[HEAD] paths=[PATHS]`: the restacked tree is that run's tree merged with the base's new commits, a merge that conflicted nowhere (`no-conflict`) or only over the version field commit-guards reads and changelog entries in the files it left conflicted (`version-only`), which `restack-skip --help` states. It starts no run. Record the skip in workflow state, with `[CONDITION]` the line's `condition=` value, `[VALIDATED_HEAD]` its `validated-head=` value and `[PATHS]` its `paths=` value, then go to step 3:

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state update [ISSUE] --arg head [HEAD] --arg condition [CONDITION] --arg validated [VALIDATED_HEAD] --arg paths [PATHS] '.restack_skips = ((.restack_skips // []) + [{head: $head, condition: $condition, validated_head: $validated, paths: (if $paths == "none" then [] else ($paths | split(",")) end)}])'
   ```

   A lane also rewrites its status file's validation line, which names the skip, its condition and its paths, as [dev-start.md § Validation status](dev-start.md#validation-status) sets out. Any other exit, whatever it prints, runs the range command over the branch as it now sits on the base, started and polled as [dev SKILL.md § Long-Running Validation](../../dev/SKILL.md#long-running-validation) sets out for the harness, the way a fix round's run is:

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/orch/scripts/dev-validate-run --worktree [WT_PATH] --validate-mode range --base origin/[BASE_BRANCH]
   ```

   Bind `[RUN_DIR]` to the run's `run-dir=` line and read its head and times after it ends:

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/orch/scripts/dev-validate-run --record --run-dir [RUN_DIR]
   ```

   `worktree-push` reads the newest finished run for the pre-push restacked head through `dev-validate-run --record` after a successful push. It records the restack stage and validation minutes once per run directory. A skipped re-test adds no stage for an earlier head's run. A failed range run reaches no push and records no restack stage.

   A start refused as `run-live` ran nothing and is no result: take [dev-implement.md § 5. Validate](../../dev/workflows/dev-implement.md#5-validate)'s route for that refusal, then start the range run again.

   Only `validate=pass` goes on to step 3. Any other result, `FAILING`, `no-verdict`, `state=timeout` or `state=lost`, pushes nothing and hands back with the verdict and the run's log path, as a fix round's red verdict ends its workflow with no second validation run. The PR stays unarmed from step 1, and this cycle never reaches step 4.

3. Push through the guarded owner:

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/orch/scripts/worktree-push --worktree [WT_PATH] --issue [ISSUE]
   ```

   This step is not skippable and no other push replaces it: the restack in step 2 rewrote every branch commit, and this command is the only thing that reconciles the SHAs workflow state recorded before it. A non-zero exit hands back, because republishing `Fixed in <sha>` replies or a closing comment over unreconciled SHAs publishes commits the branch no longer has. What it reconciles from and what its summary lines mean are in `worktree-push --help`.

   After a range run, compare the pushed head with the `head=` value of that run's record; after a skip, with the `head=` value of the skip line:

   ```bash
   git -C [WT_PATH] rev-parse HEAD
   ```

   A different head means the push rebased the branch again, onto a base that moved during the run, and pushed a head no run validated. The PR is still unarmed from step 1, so that head cannot enter the queue. Run step 2's skip check again on it, and where it does not skip, its range run and record read. Route a non-passing result as step 2 does. After a pass, bind `[RUN_DIR]` to this second run and record its timing through the same owner:

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/orch/scripts/worktree-push --record-restack-validation [RUN_DIR] --worktree [WT_PATH] --issue [ISSUE]
   ```

   This command publishes nothing. Its timing write is advisory (`worktree-push --help`). A pass or a skip goes to step 4 with no second push, and a base that moves again returns through the next queue-wait verdict. `--no-rebase` cannot hold the head still here: that push carries none of the restack's force-with-lease authorization, and git refuses the rewritten branch as a non-fast-forward push.

4. The head changed. Re-confirm the gate mode, then return to `merge-pr.md` § 5 step 1 to read the new exact head, wait for its CI and take the merge route again.

## Unarm at a stop

A PR [submit-pr.md](submit-pr.md) § 2 step 5 armed at creation stays armed until something unarms it, and a lane that stops leaves it to merge with no queue-wait guard and none of [merge-pr.md](merge-pr.md) § 5 steps 2-6. So every run that ends without a merged PR takes this section first: [submit-pr.md](submit-pr.md) § 2 step 5 on a refused re-arm, a `MERGE_READY = false` stop at [submit-pr.md](submit-pr.md) § 6.1, and every [merge-pr.md](merge-pr.md) hand-back. The caller supplies `[STATE_KEY]` and `[STOP_DIR]`, the directory its own stop route renders into.

Run step 1 above on the PR. It reads the live arm and queue membership and unarms in its order; a PR it finds neither armed nor queued needs nothing. A hand-back means its final read still found the PR armed or queued: run step 1 once more. A second hand-back replaces the caller's stop with one saying the PR is still armed, which `record` writes over any earlier stop and every later `record-if-empty` keeps, and the run ends there:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state post-pr-stop record [STATE_KEY] disarm-unconfirmed merge "PR #[PR_NUMBER] is still armed or queued: the lane could not disarm it, and GitHub can merge it with no lane watching" [STOP_DIR]/post-pr-stop-[STATE_KEY].md
```

```bash
env -u GH_REPO -u GITHUB_REPOSITORY .agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh post-comment [PR_NUMBER] --body-file [STOP_DIR]/post-pr-stop-[STATE_KEY].md
```

In a lane, also tell the overseer: write a notice naming the PR and the stop to `[STOP_DIR]/disarm-unconfirmed-[STATE_KEY].md` with the harness file-write tool, then send it:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail notice --item [STATE_KEY] --file [STOP_DIR]/disarm-unconfirmed-[STATE_KEY].md
```
