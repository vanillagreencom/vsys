# Merge-pr restack cycle

Use this cycle only for a `conflicting` queue-wait verdict. A base conflict is not a CI failure.

1. Unarm the PR before any push. If live `autoMergeRequest` is set, disable auto-merge first. If `isInMergeQueue` remains true, read the PR node id with `gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json id`, call GraphQL `dequeuePullRequest`, then re-read both fields. Either still set means hand back without pushing. This order prevents an armed PR from re-entering the queue while it is dequeued.

2. Resolve the managed worktree, then ask whether a fix round is in flight before rebasing anything:

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree path [ISSUE]
   ```

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/orch/scripts/worktree-push --check-live-round --worktree [WT_PATH] --issue [ISSUE]
   ```

   It pushes nothing. Exit 0 is the only answer that permits the restack; any other exit hands back, and the command says which it was (`worktree-push --help`). `worktree create [ISSUE] --reuse` rebases outside this check too, and carries no live-round refusal of its own.

   Then start the guarded restack:

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree create [ISSUE] --restack
   ```

   No issue worktree means hand back. On conflicts, resolve every listed file, stage it, and run `worktree restack continue [ISSUE]` until complete. Never force-push over an unresolved base.

3. Push through the guarded owner:

   ```bash
   [MAIN_REPO_ROOT]/.agents/skills/orch/scripts/worktree-push --worktree [WT_PATH] --issue [ISSUE]
   ```

4. The head changed. Re-confirm the gate mode, then return to `merge-pr.md` § 5 step 1 to read the new exact head before re-arming it and starting a new wait.
