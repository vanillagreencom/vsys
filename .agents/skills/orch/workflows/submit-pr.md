# Submit PR Workflow

Run a local pre-PR review, push, create or update the PR, triage review comments, wait for the reviewer-gate verdict, verify CI, and confirm the merge gates. The review gate (§ 4) runs before CI verification (§ 5).

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `submit-pr` | Submit the current branch as a PR |
| `submit-pr [PR#]` | Manage an existing PR |
| (from start-worktree) | Managed lifecycle with caller context |

**Caller context** (via `⤵`): `worktree`; `lifecycle` — `"managed"` (return at § 7) or `"self"` (default); `issue_id` — the workflow-state key, the normalized issue ID, never the bare GitHub issue number.

Resolve `ORCH_DECISION_MODE` once for every post-PR choice in this workflow:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/orch-env ORCH_DECISION_MODE auto-recommended
```

**With a PR number**: `github.sh pr-issue [PR_NUMBER] --format=text` gives `ISSUE_ID`; `worktree exists`/`worktree path` give `[DIR]`. When none exists from inside the PR checkout, `auto-recommended` creates one and logs the choice; `ask` prompts first. With no argument `[DIR]` is `.`. `WT_PATH` is `git-context repo-root "[DIR]"`.

**Standalone init** (`lifecycle: "self"`): resolve `ISSUE_ID` with `git-context issue-from-branch .`, then `workflow-state exists --json [ISSUE_ID]`; when absent, initialize with `git-context branch [WT_PATH]` and `workflow-state init`.

**Every path** then resolves `TRACKER` and `ISSUE_REF` from `ISSUE_ID` per [Tracker Resolution](../SKILL.md#tracker-resolution), and `SUB_ISSUE_REF` the same way from each completed sub-issue's own id; every `Closes` line renders a tracker reference only.

---

## 1. Preflight And Local Review

### 1.1 Preflight

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/resolve-base-branch "[WORKTREE_PATH]"
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/git-context branch "[WORKTREE_PATH]"
git -C "[WORKTREE_PATH]" status --porcelain
git -C "[WORKTREE_PATH]" diff "origin/[BASE_BRANCH_FROM_PREVIOUS_COMMAND]"...HEAD --stat
```

Stop before pushing when the branch is empty (detached HEAD), equals the base branch, the working tree is dirty, or the committed diff against the base is empty. Then run `.agents/skills/preflight/scripts/preflight --base "origin/[BASE_BRANCH_FROM_PREVIOUS_COMMAND]" --repo [WORKTREE_PATH]` when installed. Reuse a successful full-validation result for the current commit from an accepted dev completion artifact or this submit session. Otherwise run the project's `DEV_VALIDATE_CMD`, resolved as in [dev-implement.md § 5. Validate](../../dev/workflows/dev-implement.md#5-validate). A changed commit needs a new result. Either check failing blocks the push. In managed lifecycle, return the failed preflight to the caller so the dev agent can normalize the branch and clean the worktree. Never create a PR from dirty or detached state.

### 1.2 Size Check

The branch's added lines are measured against the allowance its issue states, once, before the push. The fix-round tripwire runs at round mint against the branch's own first commit, so a branch already grown when the PR opened never meets it.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/branch-size-check --worktree "[WORKTREE_PATH]" --issue [ISSUE_ID]
```

Exit 0 continues. Exit 3 is a refusal, not a warning: it names the count and the allowance. Cut the branch back to the Done-when and re-run it; the cut is a round like any other, the size tripwire in [references/finding-disposition.md](../references/finding-disposition.md). Adding a size-ratchet exclusion or deleting comments is not a cut. Exit 2 is a usage or environment failure whose message names the cause; report it, never push past it. An `**Expected delta**` line the check cannot parse is one such cause, corrected on the issue. When the issue states no allowance the check judges nothing, exits 0 and reports the counts; carry them into the PR body under `## Size` for the reviewer, never invent an allowance. The verdict lands in workflow state `pr.size_check`, bound to the base and head it measured; § 1.3 re-runs it after any commit it adds.

### 1.3 Local Pre-PR Review

Drain what a review bot would surface before the PR exists.

**Skip if** any holds: `lifecycle` is `"managed"`; a PR number argument was provided (arrived comments are triaged in § 3); or `.agents/skills/second-opinion/scripts/second-opinion` does not exist.

Run `second-opinion …`; it backgrounds itself and prints when to check.

```bash
mkdir -p [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/git-context timestamp epoch
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/git-context timestamp compact
.agents/skills/second-opinion/scripts/second-opinion review --cwd [WORKTREE_PATH] --output [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/review-local-[TIMESTAMP_FROM_PREVIOUS_COMMAND].json --foreground
```

Capture the launch status, stdout, and stderr. A nonzero launch or stdout with no line beginning `wait:` means no wait protocol exists: report `local external review failed — [SECOND-OPINION STDERR]` and continue to § 2 without running the wait command or `review-artifact-check`.

Execute the exact command printed after `wait:` and repeat it per its exit code (`second-opinion --help`) until terminal, doing other event checks in between, before running `review-artifact-check`.

Use the epoch output as `LOCAL_STARTED_AT`:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/review-artifact-check --file "$LOCAL_OUTPUT" [LOCAL_STARTED_AT]
```

`ok == true` → route the findings below; `reason == "valid_undermeasured"` → report its `measurement_failed` string (and `measurement_suppressed` when present) with the findings; never treat the local pass as clean. `ok == false`, or any non-zero exit, → report the `reason` and its `detail` and continue to § 2. Local review is advisory, never a submission blocker, and none of those outcomes is a pass.

Route the findings per the `review-finding` schema. Disposition every finding per [references/finding-disposition.md](../references/finding-disposition.md) § Decision flow, Step 0 first, and only what survives it enters the fix set. No blockers and no `category: "fix"` or `category: "issue"` suggestions → § 2. Otherwise delegate any blockers and fix-category suggestions: `⤵ workflows/dev-fix.md § 1-3 → § 1.3 tail` with context `worktree`, `lifecycle: "managed"`, `issue_id`, `items` (blockers plus fix-category suggestions), `source: local-review`. `category: "issue"` suggestions and the fix round's escalated items that clear the filing bar ([references/finding-disposition.md](../references/finding-disposition.md)) build an audit-input file at `tmp/audit-local-review-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` per `.agents/skills/project-management/schemas/audit-issues-input.md` with `source: "local-review"`, then go through `⤵ .agents/skills/project-management/workflows/audit-issues.md --issues [FILE_PATH] § 1-9`, each escalated item taking the `origin` its `outcome` maps to in [`review-pr.md`](review-pr.md) § 8, with the created IDs listed in the PR body.

**The loop is bounded at one confirming pass.** If dev-fix applied commits, run the review once more over the updated diff, then re-run the § 1.2 command and route its exit as § 1.2 does, and only then → § 2 regardless of what the review found. If nothing was applied, → § 2.

---

## 2. Push And Submit

1. **Push**:

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/orch/scripts/worktree-push --worktree "[WORKTREE_PATH]" --issue [ISSUE_ID] --set-upstream
   ```

   The push auto-rebases onto the updated base and reconciles every SHA workflow state records. Route its exit code and its `sha-reconcile:` line by `worktree-push --help`, which owns the reconciliation and repair contract.

   Regenerate any already-drafted publication text from the reconciled state, and resolve every SHA sourced from a review or QA artifact (e.g. a perf QA `benchmark_commit`) through `.rebase_map` before publishing it — follow the chain until no key matches. Publishing an unreconciled pre-rebase SHA is forbidden.

2. **Check for an existing PR**:

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/orch/scripts/pr-view-json "[WORKTREE_PATH]" --json number,state
   ```

   `status` of `no_pr` means create one in step 4. Stop and report auth, token, timeout, or parse errors.

3. **Build the PR body.** Write it to a file with the harness file-write tool or `apply_patch`, never redirection or a heredoc, at `[WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/pr-body-[ISSUE_ID]-[TIMESTAMP].md` (`git-context timestamp compact`), and use that path as `BODY_FILE`.

   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   [1-3 bullets describing the changes]

   ## Context
   - **[DECISION_ID]**: [ONE_LINE_SUMMARY] — `[DECISION_FILE_PATH]`
   - **Research**: [TITLE] — `[RESEARCH_FILE_PATH]`

   ## Completed Issues
   - Closes [ISSUE_REF] - [TITLE]
     - Closes [SUB_ISSUE_REF] - [SUB_TITLE]

   ## Created Issues
   - [ISSUE_ID] - [TITLE] — Project: [PROJECT]

   ## QA Metrics
   [Results from the QA agents that ran — project-configurable.]

   ## Size
   [The § 1.2 counts, only when the issue states no allowance.]

   ## Test Plan
   [validation steps]
   ```

   Omit empty sections. Decision paths come only from `decisions search --issue [ISSUE_ID]`, each verified with `test -f [DECISION_FILE_PATH]` (one command per path) and omitted on failure. Every published SHA must be post-reconciliation.

4. **Create or update the PR.** Never defer, queue, or gate CI behind bot review activity.

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh -C "[WORKTREE_PATH]" pr-create --title "[PREFIX]([ISSUE_ID]): [ISSUE_TITLE]" --body-file "$BODY_FILE"
   ```

   With an existing PR, update the body instead:

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh -C "[WORKTREE_PATH]" pr-edit-body "$PR_NUM" --body-file "$BODY_FILE"
   ```

   `[ISSUE_TITLE]` comes from `linear.sh cache issues get [ISSUE_ID]` or `gh issue view [N] --json title --jq '.title'`.

Once the PR exists, this run is a continuing action. Clear any stop a capped run left before entering another post-PR gate:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state update [ISSUE_ID] '.post_pr_stop = null'
```

---

## 3. Async Comment Triage

**Bot prose is never a gate signal** — emoji reactions, sticky comments, and checklist text are never parsed for gating. Triage what exists now and move on; every bot comment still gets a reply and a resolution.

```bash
.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh pr-threads [PR_NUMBER] --unresolved
```

`.unresolved_count == 0` → § 3.2. Otherwise **Run Workflow**: `⤵ workflows/review-pr-comments.md [PR_NUMBER] § 1-8 → § 3 tail` with managed context. That workflow records its own results (§ 8) and counts its own pass (§ 6.3); write neither here.

Do not wait for a bot re-review round — late comments are caught by the § 4 gate, the § 6.1 gate-3 check, or queue-wait's late-findings guard, which reaches `merge-pr.md` § 5 step 1 as the `dequeued` verdict and routes to its Late-findings triage cycle.

The **re-submit set** is the issues this session filed for work the cap did not deny. A filing that stood in for a fix the cap refused — one made at or past `REVIEW_MAX_EXTERNAL_ROUNDS`, or deferred rather than fixed — is recorded in `pr_comment_review.issues_created` and reported in the PR body, and never enters the set: implementing it here is the fix the cap refused, one step later. The re-submit set needs implementing before merge, bounded at two re-submit cycles:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '.submit_cycles // 0'
```

At 2 or more → § 3.2 with the note "max re-submit cycles reached, the re-submit set may need manual implementation". Otherwise increment `submit_cycles`, implement via `⤵ workflows/dev-start.md § 1-4`, review via `⤵ workflows/review-pr.md § 1-9` (both managed, same `worktree` and `issue_id`), then re-enter § 2 to push and update the PR body with the new `Closes` lines.

### 3.2 Golden Baselines

**Skip if** the issue does not carry the `design` label (`linear.sh cache issues get [ISSUE_ID] --format=compact`, or `gh issue view [N] --json labels`).

Capture golden baselines in the worktree with the project's visual QA tooling; if the project has no baseline-capable target, skip and report why. Commit and push without retriggering CI:

```bash
git -C [WT_PATH] add [BASELINE_PATH]/
git -C [WT_PATH] commit -m "chore: update golden baselines [skip ci]"
.agents/skills/worktree/scripts/worktree push [WT_PATH] --no-rebase
```

---

## 4. Review Gate

The review gate runs **before** CI verification, universally, with no repo detection. Named stops below use [SKILL.md § The Cycle](../SKILL.md#the-cycle).

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/approval-wait --resolve-mode
```

The printed value is `GATE_MODE` — `approval`, `review`, or `off` (full semantics: [references/gates.md](../references/gates.md)); never re-derive it here. This gate reads only GitHub-native review state, from any reviewer, human or bot; bot-specific signals are never parsed.

Record the resolved mode as a bare word (never pre-quoted):

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state set [ISSUE_ID] pr_review.mode [GATE_MODE]
```

For `off`, skip the wait and go to § 5 — the internal review, CI, and comment-hygiene gates still apply in full.

1. **Wait.** Poll for the verdict and new comments together:

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/orch/scripts/approval-wait [PR_NUMBER] 30 --json --mode [GATE_MODE]
   ```

   No `max_wait` positional: the budget resolves through `PR_REVIEW_WAIT_SECS`. approval-wait always emits a JSON result.

   | `status` | Action |
   |----------|--------|
   | `approved`, `unresolved_count == 0` | Clear the review-wait budget, then → step 2 |
   | `approved`, `unresolved_count > 0` | Run the triage pass below. Pushed no commits → the approval stands, → step 2. Pushed commits → the Restart check |
   | `reviewed` | Clear the review-wait budget, then → step 2 |
   | `proceeded` | Reviewer-down degrade under `PR_REVIEW_ON_TIMEOUT=proceed`. Clear the review-wait budget, record `pr_approval.reviewer_down` (below), then → step 2. CI and gate 3 still apply in full. Orch posts no status and manufactures no review evidence |
   | `changes_requested` or `comments` | Run the triage pass, then the Restart check |
   | `timeout` | `auto-recommended` logs `Keep waiting` and enters the Restart check; `ask` presents `Force merge` \| `Keep waiting` \| `Stop here`, with `Keep waiting` recommended |
   | `error` | Re-run step 1 once. If it repeats, `auto-recommended` records `review-gate-read-failed`; `ask` presents `Keep waiting` \| `Stop here`, with `Keep waiting` recommended |

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state set [ISSUE_ID] pr_approval.reviewer_down true
   ```

   A met gate clears its head-bound budget:

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state update [ISSUE_ID] '.post_pr_budgets.review_wait = null'
   ```

   **Triage pass**: `⤵ workflows/review-pr-comments.md [PR_NUMBER] § 1-8 → § 4 step 1` with managed context. It applies the external cap to its own fix pushes; what bounds this step is the Restart check.

   **Restart check.** Every automatic path that would restart the wait passes through the one atomic budget owner first. Resolve the authoritative head immediately before each take so a triage push resets the counter:

   ```bash
   env -u GH_REPO -u GITHUB_REPOSITORY gh pr view [PR_NUMBER] --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid
   ```

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state head-budget take [ISSUE_ID] review-wait [REVIEW_HEAD]
   ```

   `continue` restarts step 1; `at-cap` records `review-round-cap` through `post-pr-stop`, posts the rendered comment, returns `MERGE_READY = false`, and skips § 5:

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state post-pr-stop record [ISSUE_ID] review-round-cap review "[REMAINING_FEEDBACK]" [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/post-pr-stop-[ISSUE_ID].md
   ```

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh post-comment [PR_NUMBER] --body-file [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/post-pr-stop-[ISSUE_ID].md
   ```

   `ask` presents `Triage again` | `Force merge` | `Stop here`, with `Triage again` recommended, before an automatic budget transition. A standing `changes_requested` verdict on the current head outlives a disposition. Only a dismissal or a newer review clears it. Under `ask`, `Triage again` is the user's override for one more pass, `Force merge` records the override and continues to step 2 with the § 6.1 gates applying, and `Stop here` goes to § 6 with `MERGE_READY = false` and skips § 5.

   **On `timeout` under `ask`**: `Keep waiting` goes to the Restart check; `Force merge` records the override and continues to step 2 with the § 6.1 gates still applying; `Stop here` goes to § 6 with `MERGE_READY = false` and skips § 5.

   ```bash
   .agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state set [ISSUE_ID] pr_approval.forced true
   ```

2. **Record the result** for gate 4 — the gate status and the `unresolved_count` at verdict time — then → § 5.

After any fix-up push: push → the Restart check, and on a restart wait for a NEW review of the new head → triage, reply to, and resolve every thread → § 5 Verify CI → § 6 merge gates.

---

## 5. Verify CI

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/ci-wait [PR_NUMBER] --json
```

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `status=complete`, `verdict=pass` | → § 6 |
| `status=complete`, `verdict=none` | Repo has no CI configured. Record `ci: none` in workflow state and → § 6 |
| `status=complete`, `verdict=fail` | → § 5.1 |
| `status=timeout` or `status=error` | Re-run once. If it repeats, `auto-recommended` records `ci-status-unconfirmed`; `ask` presents `Skip CI` \| `Retry` \| `Abort`, with `Retry` recommended |

### 5.1 CI Failure Recovery

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state cap CI_FIX_MAX_CYCLES
```

The printed value is `MAX_CYCLES`. Reruns-in-place are for flakes and re-gating on unchanged workflows only; a PR that changes gate or CI workflow behavior exhibits it only on a fresh head.

**Run Workflow**: `⤵ workflows/ci-fix.md [PR_NUMBER] § 1-6 → § 5.1 tail` with context `worktree`, `lifecycle: "managed"`, `issue_id`. ci-fix pushes, re-confirms the § 4 gate at the new head, and only then re-verifies CI. Record its gate re-confirmation as the § 4 result (skip when `GATE_MODE` is `off`), treat its final CI result as the § 5 result, and re-route through the table above. A returned `comments` or `changes_requested` routes through the § 4 step-1 table first, then re-enters § 5.

Keep routing failures back into ci-fix until CI passes or `MAX_CYCLES` is spent. At the cap, go to § 6 with a failure report that names the checks still failing, quotes ci-fix's last error summary, and lists what each cycle attempted — never a bare "CI is failing".

---

## 6. Merge Gates And Summary

### 6.1 Merge Gates

A PR merges on exactly four deterministic gates. Gates 2 and 4 **verify results already recorded** by § 5 and § 4 — do not re-run the waits; gate 3 is a final live check.

| # | Gate | Check |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | Internal review verdict recorded | Managed: `review-pr.md` completed with verdict `pass`. Standalone: `json_paths` is non-empty |
| 2 | CI green | The § 5 result is `status=complete` with `verdict=pass`, or `verdict=none` (satisfied with a `CI: none configured` note in the summary) |
| 3 | Zero unresolved review comments | `pr-threads` reports `unresolved_count == 0` AND every actionable PR-level bot comment has a reply (tracked in `pr_comment_review.replied`) |
| 4 | Reviewer-gate verdict | `approval`: § 4 ended `approved`. `review`: § 4 ended `reviewed`. Either mode is also met by a recorded `pr_approval.forced` or `pr_approval.reviewer_down`. `off`: not applicable |

**Gate 1** — standalone only:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '{json_paths: (.json_paths // []), cycles: (.cycles // 0)}'
```

Empty `json_paths` means no internal review is recorded: report the unmet gate and recommend `orch review-pr [PR_NUMBER]`.

**Gate 2** = the recorded § 5 result — do not re-run ci-wait, and raw `gh pr checks` output is never the gate. On a `pr-merge --check` refusal run `.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh ci-classify-refusal [PR_NUMBER]` and route on its `cause:` line: `threads` → gate 3; anything else → report the cause with its printed detail (for `ci_failed` that includes the `fail:` and `superseded:` run ids) rather than forcing or abandoning the merge.

**Gate 3** — final live check:

```bash
.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh pr-threads [PR_NUMBER] --unresolved
```

`unresolved_count > 0` runs ONE triage pass (`⤵ workflows/review-pr-comments.md [PR_NUMBER] § 1-8 → § 6.1 gate 3`, managed, bounded by the same `REVIEW_MAX_EXTERNAL_ROUNDS` cap on `pr_comment_review.iterations`). If that pass pushed commits, re-confirm the § 4 gate through its Restart check with a short wait (skip when `GATE_MODE` is `off`), then re-run § 5:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/approval-wait [PR_NUMBER] 15 300 --json --mode [GATE_MODE]
```

Re-run the gate-3 command once. If threads remain and the external-round cap is below, `auto-recommended` logs `Triage again` and runs one more pass; at the cap it records `review-threads-open`. Under `ask`, present `Triage again` | `Force merge` | `Stop here`, with `Triage again` recommended.

**Gate 4** — verify the recorded § 4 result. Read the recorded mode:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '.pr_review.mode // ""'
```

`MERGE_READY = true` only when all four gates are met.

### 6.2 Consumer Admin-Merge Question

**Skip if** the repository is `vanillagreencom/kendex`, where these files are the product, or `MERGE_READY = true`, where the gates already cleared the merge.

When the diff touches no product code, only harness renders, settings, or prose, an unmet gate has nothing left to judge. Whether to merge past it anyway is a question orch poses and never answers. Under `auto-recommended` orch takes the recommended `Continue through the gates` and moves on; under `ask` a person or the overseer answers.

Ask once, naming what the diff touches and which gate is unmet: `Admin-merge past the unmet gate` | `Continue through the gates`, with `Continue through the gates` recommended. Both the reason and the answer go in the PR body under `## Merge decision`. An admin answer invokes `⤵ workflows/merge-pr.md [PR_NUMBER] § 1-7` with `merge_mode: admin`. Anything else continues to § 6.3.

### 6.3 Standalone Summary

**Skip if** managed → § 7.

`MERGE_READY = false` records the unmet gate here, so § 7 returns a named stop instead of reading as complete; only the managed `start-worktree.md` § 5 caller recorded it before. `record-if-empty` keeps a precise upstream stop, and only `recorded` writes the file the post below sends:

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state post-pr-stop record-if-empty [ISSUE_ID] merge-gates-unmet merge "[UNMET_GATE_AND_REMAINING_WORK]" [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/post-pr-stop-[ISSUE_ID].md
.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh post-comment [PR_NUMBER] --body-file [WORKTREE_PATH]/tmp/post-pr-stop-[ISSUE_ID].md
```

Post a summary comment when there were fixes or created issues. Fix SHAs come from workflow state; artifact-sourced SHAs resolve through `.rebase_map` first. Write the summary to a file and post it:

```bash
.agents/skills/github/scripts/github.sh post-comment [PR_NUMBER] --body-file "$SUMMARY_FILE"
```

Linear items also get it on the issue; GitHub items get linkage through `Closes #N` in the PR body:

```bash
.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh comments create [ISSUE_ID] --body-file "$SUMMARY_FILE"
```

```markdown

`auto` → merge without asking: `⤵ workflows/merge-pr.md [PR_NUMBER] § 1-7 → end`. Anything else → ask `orch merge-pr [PR_NUMBER]` | `Skip`, and on merge run the same workflows. `MERGE_READY = false` never auto-merges.

---

## 7. Return

**Managed**: return to the parent workflow's next section with the § 6.1 gate results (`MERGE_READY`, the § 4 gate mode and status, the unresolved thread count, the § 5 CI verdict). **Standalone**: return `.post_pr_stop` when present; otherwise the session is complete.
