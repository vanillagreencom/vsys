# Handoff Workflow

Launch one or more independent work-item sessions. Launch-only: nothing here monitors what it starts.

| Input | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `tracker` | `linear` or `github` |
| `items` | Linear IDs or GitHub issue numbers |
| `repo` | Required for GitHub when `gh repo view` cannot resolve it |
| `harness` | `claude`, `codex`, `codex-app`, `opencode`, or `pi` |

## 0. Resolve The Harness

An explicit user choice wins. Otherwise, with several items and `codex_app.create_thread` exposed, use `codex-app`; else resolve the normal terminal harness for this environment.

## 1. Gate The Launch List

**Container preflight** — Linear items only, before any worktree is created.

```bash
.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh sync --reconcile
.agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh cache issues get [ITEM] --with-bundle
```

Apply the Ancestor gate ([references/skill-rules.md § Coordination](../references/skill-rules.md#coordination)) per item. A container drops off the launch list and is replaced by its unblocked DIRECT children (`depth == 0`), each of which reruns this preflight. A blocked item drops off with its live blockers named.

- **The explicit-choice exception survives.** An enclosing `(one PR)` ancestor makes that bundle the launch item only for container-expanded entries; an item the USER supplied explicitly stays the launch item, still gated on the unioned blockers.
- **Deduplicate, then collapse ancestry.** Keep one entry per issue id, marking it EXPLICIT whenever any duplicate was user-supplied. Then, when one final item is an ancestor bundle of another, keep only the bundle.

### Launch Handoff

| Tracker | [linear\|github] |
| Items | [ITEMS] |
| Harness | [HARNESS] |
| Follow-up | No monitoring; each launched session owns its work item |

## 2. Launch

### Terminal harnesses

**Skip if** `harness == codex-app`.

Choose the launch flags for THIS task before launching — model, effort, and permission posture are a per-task judgment, sized to the item's difficulty. A claude lane must include a permission-bypass flag (`open-terminal` warns when the flags omit one).

Omit `--tmux` and `--ghostty` unless the user explicitly requests a terminal-mode override. With neither flag `open-terminal` auto-detects the mode: tmux windows inside tmux, GUI terminals outside it. What the screen looks like is not a request; `--ghostty` inside tmux moves the lane out of the workspace.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/open-terminal --tracker linear --harness [HARNESS] --launch-flags "[FLAGS]" [ISSUE_IDS]
```

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/open-terminal --tracker github --repo [OWNER/REPO] --harness [HARNESS] --launch-flags "[FLAGS]" [NUMBERS]
```

Add `--lane auto` (or `auto:<harness>`) to launch under the qualifying account with the fewest launches already in flight, headroom breaking the tie; it refuses to launch when no lane is under the usage threshold. On tmux it re-picks before each further item. `--lane <alias>` picks a named lane from `ORCH_LANE_ALIASES`, and `--lane <config-dir>` a literal one.

### Codex Desktop threads

**Skip if** `harness != codex-app`. Use this branch only inside a runtime that exposes the `codex_app` thread tools; never emulate app handoff with terminal launch, `codex debug app-server`, raw `codex app-server`, or manual instructions.

```bash
.agents/skills/orch/scripts/resolve-base-branch .
```

For each item, create exactly one thread with `codex_app.create_thread`, targeting the current saved project with a separate worktree environment for that issue: never run all issues in the controller thread, never launch several in one child thread, and never pass several issue IDs to one thread. Set the worktree `startingState` to `{type: "branch", branchName: "[BASE_BRANCH]"}`; use `working-tree` only when the user explicitly asks for a dirty local snapshot. The prompt is `$orch start [ISSUE_ID]` (or `$orch start github [OWNER/REPO]#[N]`). If the runtime creates the thread before accepting a prompt, call `codex_app.send_message_to_thread` once with that same prompt. Title the thread with the item identifier when `codex_app.set_thread_title` is exposed, and record the returned thread ID.
