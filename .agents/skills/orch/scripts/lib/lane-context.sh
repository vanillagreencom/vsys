# Context use per live work lane, read from the lane's own pane status line
# and nothing else. A harness session file is a private format whose fields
# are ambiguous to anyone but the harness; the status line is the number the
# harness itself stands behind, on the screen the operator is looking at.
#
# Two shapes, two directions:
#   Claude prints `Opus 5 41%`       — the percentage USED.
#   Codex  prints `Context 86% left` — the percentage REMAINING, or
#                 `Context 14% used` when its status item is configured the
#                 other way round. Both spellings ship in one binary.
# The shape that matched decides the direction, so nothing has to record
# which harness a pane runs. Both are reported as CONTEXT_USED_PCT: one
# direction, and a rising number always means a fuller context.
#
# WHERE the status line sits differs by harness, and that is what decides
# how each one is found.
#
# Codex draws its status line LAST. In every captured pane it is the final
# non-empty row, with blank rows and nothing else below it, so the codex
# reading is taken from that row and from no other row on the screen. A
# final row that is not a status line is no reading at all, never a search
# up the transcript for something shaped like one. POSITION carries that
# refusal because shape cannot: codex's status items are user-configured
# (`[tui].status_line` — model with reasoning, git branch, project name,
# codex version, tokens used, working directory), and `gpt-6-astra default`
# is a configured item while `compact now` is a sentence about compaction,
# and the two are the same shape. A reader that refuses what it does not
# recognise leaves the lane unmeasured, and an unmeasured lane is never
# compacted — which is the outcome compaction exists to prevent. So what
# follows the separator is taken as it comes.
#
# Claude draws ONE ROW PER RUNNING AGENT below its status line, so the
# footer grows with the fleet — and the deepest footers belong to the
# orchestrating lanes, the ones this measurement exists for. Its status line
# is never the final row, so the claude reading is the BOTTOM-MOST whole-line
# match instead: anything above it is a prior render of the same lane,
# from before it compacted. Bottom-most is safe only because a reading is a
# whole STATUS LINE and never a fragment prose can carry too: otherwise the
# lowest sentence naming a model and a percentage beats the real status line
# above it.
#
# A screen that outlived its harness is refused rather than measured, and
# that refusal takes positive evidence, never distance: the pane's
# foreground process must BE a harness this reader knows. A pane that has
# outlived its harness would otherwise have its last render reported as
# current forever.
#
# A lane is live while its claim's pane is (lib/lane-claims.sh). A pane that
# cannot be captured — on another tmux server, or gone between the claim read
# and here — is reported `unreadable` with no number: an unmeasured lane must
# never read as an empty one.

# The foreground processes that ARE a harness, matched whole. A denylist of
# shells cannot establish that one is running: after a harness exits, a pane
# running less, vim or git log still holds the old footer and passes any
# not-a-shell test. `[a-z0-9]*claude` covers the per-account wrappers this
# fleet launches through — nclaude, dclaude, 1claude — which exec the real
# binary, and agent-confine is the launcher both harnesses exec through, so
# it names neither. Anything else is refused BY NAME, so a harness missing

# Read one context figure from a captured screen on stdin. $1 is the pane's
# foreground process, which `lane_context_shape` turns into the shape offered.
# Prints `<harness>\t<used percent>\t<context tokens>`; exits 1 when the
# shape offered found nothing. The token figure is the percentage times the
# window the status line itself names — Claude's `(1M context)` parenthetical
# between the version and the percentage — and is empty on a line naming
# none: the codex status line never names its window, and a Claude session
# on its default window prints no parenthetical. The overseer's handoff mark
# is an absolute token count, so a lane with no figure never reaches it.
#
# The codex shape is offered the FINAL NON-EMPTY line and no other. The
# claude shape is offered every line and its LAST match wins; no window is
# taken off the bottom, because the footer under a claude status line is one
# row per running agent and has no bound, so any count would lose exactly the
# busiest lanes. Where both are offered, a final line carrying the codex shape
# settles the reading, out of range included: falling through to a claude
# match higher up would be the search the position rule exists to refuse. On a
# codex pane there is no falling through at all — the claude shape is never
# offered, so a screen that does not end in a codex status line is
# could-not-tell however much of this fleet's transcript sits above it.
#
# Matching is done on a lowercased copy of each line: a model name is a word,
# and the harness spells it differently in different places. The claude
# reading is a WHOLE LINE, never a fragment of one: the status line runs
# `<cwd> [(<branch>)] <model> <version> [(<window>)] <N>% (<account>)`, so a
# match starts at the line's own beginning with a working directory and runs
# to the line's own END. BOTH ends, because either alone leaves the fragment
# in: prose carries it before — `Opus 5 92% is already heavily used` — and
# after — `/fake Opus 5 99% (work) is an example`, whose status-shaped PREFIX
# matched while the sentence it sits in did not have to. Under a bottom-most
# rule either sentence outranks the real status line above it. What the
# account may be followed by is claude's own right-hand hint, a slash
# command (`/rc`) — never running text. The branch parenthetical is optional:
# a lane outside a repository has none, and a session that has not rendered a
# percentage yet matches nothing at all.
# The codex reading is a WHOLE LINE at its OPENING and takes what follows as
# it comes. The context item opens the line — leading whitespace or box
# decoration only, nothing alphanumeric — so `Documentation: Context 60% used
# means compact now` is not one, and `Context 60% used means compact now`
# needs the separator its configured items are drawn behind. Past that
# separator the line is read no further. Every candidate for the job — a path
# (`/var/tmp/…`), a model with its reasoning effort (`gpt-6-astra default`), a
# git branch, a project name, a version, a token count — is one to three bare
# words, and so is a sentence's opening; a shape that admits the ones this
# reader has seen and refuses the rest refuses configured status lines it has
# not seen, and leaves those lanes unmeasured. Position is what keeps prose
# out, so the shape does not have to try.
# Codex's status item is user-configured and both directions ship, so both
# are matched and only `left` is converted. A percentage over 100 is not a
# context figure and is dropped rather than reported, whichever shape carried
# it.
