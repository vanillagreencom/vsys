# response left in the context and its verified compaction point, and records that
# reading in the session's mailbox directory. Every other reader, `lanes

# The config directory a session of shape $1 runs its credential out of: a
# lane's, and an overseer's where its launch record names none. `lanes context`
# asks it about the pane it is reading, and the lane's own turn-end hook asks
# it about itself, so one lane is never joined to one account by the report and
# to another by the hook that hands it off. A recorded overseer's account is
# its launch record's (lib/overseer-launch.sh § ol_record_current), which
# `oversee-succeed` judges it on; `lanes context` still reads this function
# alone, so its row for that overseer can name another account where the
# session's environment disagrees with its record.
#
# Which variable names the account is decided by the SHAPE, never by which
# variable happens to be set: every launcher here prefixes one without clearing
# the other, so both can be, and reading Claude's on a Codex session reports a
# whole other account's headroom. A session started by hand sets neither, which
# is the overseer, and takes the directory its harness itself defaults to. A
# shape naming neither harness has only the variables to go on and takes one
# only where exactly one is set, so no session is joined to an account that was
# never established; empty is the honest answer, and its caller reports an
# account it could not name rather than reading it as room.
#
# What CODEX_HOME holds is not always an account. A codex launch that had to
# make its own folder-trust record runs under a private home built under one,
# so lib/lane-home.sh turns such a path back into the account it was built
# under. Without that the mail a turn-end hook hands off, and the lane it has
# `lanes pick` judge, name a directory no claim was taken on, and a second
# session is launched onto an account this one is already spending. Both arms
# that can answer with that variable go through the rule: the codex shape, and
# the shape naming no harness, which is what a pane running `lanes` itself
# offers. A claude answer passes through it unchanged, carrying no such shape.
# `pi` is no shape a pane offers: it is the Copilot pool's account harness a
# pi overseer names (lib/overseer-launch.sh § ol_account), whose account is the
# Pi root it runs on, PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR or the home's `.pi/agent`.

# The caller's own row carries a leading `*` on its lane name. An overseer is
# told its own pane is in this report, and without a mark it has no way to
# find the row — its HANDOFF cell speaks for the lane threshold, which by
# default is the lower figure, so that cell reads `-` at a headroom already
# past the overseer's own succession trigger. Nothing orders the two
# settings, so the legend states the comparison as the default it is.
