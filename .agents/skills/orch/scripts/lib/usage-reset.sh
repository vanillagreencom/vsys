# shellcheck shell=bash
# Reading a harness usage-limit banner's reset clause. What shape a reset
# clause comes in, and what instant it names given the moment the banner was
# seen. Pure string-to-string: nothing here reads a pane, a tmux window, an
# event or the watch state, and `die` is its only import from the script that
# sources it.
#
# Sourced, never run. lib/date-ladder.sh must be sourced first. Beyond it the
# file imports one name, `die`, and takes the banner lines to read as an
# argument rather than reaching for the predicate that found them.

# The reset clause the same banner line states. Three tails, tried in this
# order. Every arm states its evidence at one of three GRADES, and an arm that
# can state none does not exist: MEASURED in a shipped binary, RECORDED in this
# repository as the CLI's own copy, or ACCEPTED on the grammar of the sibling
# parser this repository already has for the question,
# pi-extensions/pi-agents-tmux/extensions/subagent/rate-limit-reset.ts. Naming
# a source is not a grade; a hand-written assertion string and a captured pane
# are not the same evidence.
#   dated    `resets Sep 6, 4pm`, `resets Oct 7, 2027, 11:32am` — MEASURED in
#            Claude Code 2.1.258, whose `Td()` formats through `Intl` in en-US
#            past 24 hours out, lowercases the meridiem and drops the space
#            before it, and prints the year only when it is not the current
#            one. Codex 0.152.1 draws the same tail with an ordinal day and no
#            comma before the clock (`Try again at Sep 6th, 2026 4:30 PM`):
#            MEASURED as ` Try again at `, `%b %-d`, the `stndrdth` ordinal
#            table and `, %Y %-I:%M %p` at adjacent offsets in its binary.
#            Both are covered, and both triggers come from these two readings.
#   weekday  `resets Thursday 4am` — RECORDED, at
#            pi-extensions/pi-claude-bridge/tests/unit-usage-limit.mjs, as the
#            CLI's official limit copy, and reaching a pane through a result
#            payload's `errors` array rather than as a banner the TUI draws.
#            NOT measured: 2.1.258 cannot print it, since every reset clause
#            routes through `Td()` and neither of its option objects carries a
#            `weekday` key.
#   clock    `resets 9:50am (America/Los_Angeles)` — MEASURED, same formatter
#            inside 24 hours, with the IANA zone in parentheses when the banner
#            asks for one. The meridiem is optional so `resets 21:00` reads
#            too, and that is ACCEPTED only: `Td()` prints a clock only with
#            `hour12` set, on both its branches, and omits the clock entirely
#            otherwise, while the `timeFormat` setting reaches the
#            message-timestamp and UI-clock formatters and never `Td()`.
# A clock inside a fall-back hour names two instants in its zone. A dayless
# tail resolves them by the same rule as any other candidate, the first after
# the sighting; a dated tail, having no sighting to order them against, takes
# the later.
# Deliberately outside: a duration (Claude's `resets in 5m` for a fast-mode
# cooldown), a weekday with no clock, and a bare number carrying neither
# minutes nor a meridiem. Each leaves the event without a time rather than
# with a guessed one.
