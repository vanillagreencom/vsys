# The MEASUREMENT gates: did the artifact's own measurements produce samples,
# and does it declare an instrument that did not? Separate from
# review-artifact-gates.sh, which asks whether the review happened at all and
# whether its findings are routable — a different question about a different
# part of the artifact.
#
# Both gates run through review-artifact-gates.sh's gate_filter and obey its
# three-channel rule: answer on stdout, diagnostic on the error file, ran-or-not
# on the exit status.

# Sourced by: review-artifact-gates.sh.

# The artifact's instrument-failure declaration, read ONCE and adjudicated here.
# Prints "absent:", "declared:<text>", or "invalid:<why>" — one reading of the
# field, so the echoed value and the decision to suppress the zero-sample gate
# cannot disagree about the same artifact.
#
# Top-level, not under qa_metadata: a declaration is a statement about the RUN,
# like verdict, and burying it in the QA payload made reaching it require
# adopting the qa shape (and its finding-array contract), so a tolerant-shape
# reviewer following the rejection's own instruction hit a second refusal.
# Keeping it out of qa_metadata also keeps it out of the citation scan, so a
# declaration that names the zeros it observed cannot trip the gate it exists
# to release.

# a measurement instrument that produced no samples still emits a
# number, and a zero reads as green. Two shapes are refused.
#
# The SAMPLE COUNT — the denominator of the reviewer skill's fixed citation
# format (`mutation: killed X/X; stability: Y/N at T threads`) and its thread
# count. Only the count: `stability: 0/10` is ten runs of which none passed, a
# fully measured concurrency failure that SKILL.md calls "never a pass" and
# this gate must therefore let through as a finding. Reading the numerator
# would suppress exactly that.
#
# The PERF PAYLOAD — checked by requiring evidence rather than by detecting its
# absence, because absence has too many spellings (missing key, [], null
# leaves, "0ms" strings) and every one of them is what a harness that produced
# nothing most naturally emits. A perf_qa payload must carry a percentiles
# block with at least one numeric leaf above zero.
#
# CARRIERS: `.summary` and `.qa_metadata` only — the places an artifact states
# its OWN evidence. blockers[]/suggestions[]/questions[] describe the code under
# review, so a reviewer quoting a fixture, a log line, or another tool's zeroed
# run puts it there and the gate stays out of its way. Scanning every leaf left
# no honest route for that: the reviewer had to delete its evidence or declare
# an instrument failure that was not its own.
#
# The declaration escape is NOT read here. measurement_declaration adjudicates
# it once and artifact_content_gates skips this gate outright, so there is one
# reading of the field rather than two that can drift.
