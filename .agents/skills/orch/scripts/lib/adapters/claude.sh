# The Claude Code adapter: the context a session has used and the window it has,
# read from the transcript Claude Code writes. The launch word that keeps the
# harness from compacting a session on its own is the claude row of the
# launch-choice table in lib/lane-launch.sh.
#
# Sourced by lib/lane-context.sh, never run.

# The window a Claude model runs on. The transcript names the model on every
# assistant line (`claude-opus-5-5`) and never the window, so the window is the
# one this fleet has measured for the model's tier word, the largest prompt a
# model of that tier has been sent here. A tier this table leaves out has no
# window, and its sessions are reported unmeasured rather than judged against
# a guess: too small a figure hands a session off early, too large one lets it
# run into its wall.
