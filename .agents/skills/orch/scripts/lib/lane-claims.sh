# Live launch claims per auth lane: one file per lane window launched under a
# resolved lane, so `lanes pick` sees the launches already in flight on an
# account instead of only its usage numbers, which lag a launch by minutes.
#
# Home: $OVERSEE_WATCH_STATE_DIR/claims, else <project root>/tmp/oversee-watch/
# claims — the directory oversee-watch keeps its own state in.
#
# A claim is live while its tmux pane is. The liveness key is
# `<server pid> <pane id>`: pane ids restart at %0 on a separate tmux server, so the
# pid keeps a claim that outlived its server from matching an unrelated pane.
#
# `tmux list-panes -a` sees ONE server — the current client's. It is authority
# over claims carrying that server's pid, and says nothing about the rest: a
# claim on another socket, or one this process could not enumerate at all, is
# judged by whether its server process still runs. Deleting a claim we could
# not measure would report a busy account as free, so it is kept and counted
# until its server is provably gone. A server process another account owns
# refuses `kill -0` as EPERM, which is no evidence it is gone: only the owning
# account can tell, so that claim is kept and counted too. Claims are recorded
# for tmux lanes only — a launch with no pane handle would leave a claim
# nothing can prune.
#
# One store can serve several homes on one host, each home's claims directory a
# link to it: every record is written group-readable whatever the writer's
# umask, so a store whose group every fleet user shares reads across homes, and
# `lanes` counts a claim by the account its config dir names, never by the
# home-specific path alone.
#
# Record: `<server pid>\t<pane id>\t<config dir>\t<window>\t<created at>\t
# <fleet>\t<named>\t<kind>`.
# The config dir is canonical; `named` is the spelling the launch named the lane
# by, before canonicalisation, so a reader can name the account as `lanes list`
# does from a discovered path. A record written before it carried one has none,
# and a reader names that claim's account from its canonical config dir.
# The fleet is the oversee state file of the fleet the launch was judged in
# (`open-terminal --state-dir`), empty for a launch naming no fleet, and it is
# what lets one store serve several fleets: open-terminal's launch cap counts
# only its own fleet's claims, while `lanes pick` charges an account with
# whatever fleet's claims name it. A claim with an empty fleet, written by a
# launch naming no fleet or before claims carried one, counts toward its
# account and toward no fleet's cap; a fleet's report (lane_claims_for_fleet)
# takes it as the lane of that fleet's running or preparing record whose window
# and account it names.
#
# A reservation is the same record under `.reserve`, with the launcher's pid as
# its server and `-` as its pane: the place in the count a judged launch holds
# from its count until its claim or record stands, or the item ends, live while
# that launcher runs. Its config dir is empty: only the count and cap modes of
# lane_claims_read carry reservations, and the launch cap judges
# a reservation by its window, fleet and kind, never its account. Every other reader
# reads claims alone.
