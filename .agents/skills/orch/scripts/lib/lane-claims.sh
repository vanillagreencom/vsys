# Live launch claims per auth lane: one file per lane window launched under a
# resolved lane, so `lanes pick` sees the launches already in flight on an
# account instead of only its usage numbers, which lag a launch by minutes.
#
# Home: $OVERSEE_WATCH_STATE_DIR/claims, else <project root>/tmp/oversee-watch/
# claims — the directory oversee-watch keeps its own state in.
#
# A claim is live while its tmux pane is. The liveness key is
# `<server pid> <pane id>`: pane ids restart at %0 on a separate tmux server, so the
# pid keeps a claim that outlived its server from matching an unrelated pane.
#
# `tmux list-panes -a` sees ONE server — the current client's. It is authority
# over claims carrying that server's pid, and says nothing about the rest: a
# claim on another socket, or one this process could not enumerate at all, is
# judged by whether its server process still runs. Deleting a claim we could
# not measure would report a busy account as free, so it is kept and counted
# until its server is provably gone. Claims are recorded for tmux lanes only —
# a launch with no pane handle would leave a claim nothing can prune.
#
# Record: `<server pid>\t<pane id>\t<config dir>\t<window>\t<created at>\t<fleet>`.
# The fleet is the oversee state file of the fleet the launch was judged in
# (`open-terminal --state-dir`), empty for a launch naming no fleet, and it is
# what lets one store serve several fleets: open-terminal's fleet cap counts
# only its own fleet's claims, while `lanes pick` charges an account with
# whatever fleet's claims name it. A claim with an empty fleet, written by a
# launch naming no fleet or before claims carried one, counts toward its
# account and toward no fleet's cap; a fleet's report (lane_claims_for_fleet)
# takes it as the lane of that fleet's running or preparing record whose window
# and account it names.
#
# A reservation is the same record under `.reserve`, with the launcher's pid as
# its server and `-` as its pane: the place in the count a judged launch holds
# from its count until its claim or record stands, or the item ends, live while
# that launcher runs. Its config dir is empty: only the count form of
# lane_claims_read carries reservations, and the fleet cap that reads it judges
# a reservation by its window and fleet, never its account. Every other reader
# reads claims alone.
