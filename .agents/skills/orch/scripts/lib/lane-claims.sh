# A claim is live while its tmux pane is. The liveness key is
# `<server pid> <pane id>`: pane ids restart at %0 on a separate tmux server, so the
# pid keeps a claim that outlived its server from matching an unrelated pane.

# `tmux list-panes -a` sees ONE server — the current client's. It is authority
# over claims carrying that server's pid, and says nothing about the rest: a
# claim on another socket, or one this process could not enumerate at all, is
# judged by whether its server process still runs. Deleting a claim we could
# not measure would report a busy account as free, so it is kept and counted
# until its server is provably gone. Claims are recorded for tmux lanes only —
# a launch with no pane handle would leave a claim nothing can prune.
#
# Record: `<server pid>\t<pane id>\t<config dir>\t<window>\t<created at>`.
