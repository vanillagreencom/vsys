# The steps every overseer launch takes, whoever asks for one: `oversee
# launch` opening a fleet's first overseer, and `oversee-succeed` opening a
# successor in a predecessor's place. One launcher, so a first launch and a
# succession cannot come to open, verify or record a session differently.
# What differs between them is policy and stays with the caller: which marks
# fire, how a predecessor's flags carry over, which entries the account walk
# tries. `oversee-watch` sources it too, through lib/watch-overseer-record.sh,
# for OL_JQ_DEFS alone. What is shared is here:

#   ol_lanes               `lanes` on this machine's copy of each account
#   ol_pick_record         one `lanes pick --json` record, for a caller's
#                          own counts
#   ol_pick_lane           one `lanes pick` for one entry, with the counts a
#                          refusal reports
#   ol_command_line        the harness command for a picked lane, brief
#                          included, made trusted and put under the lane form
#   ol_identity            the launch identity the next record write stores
#   ol_runtime_supported   the runtime resolved and held to the one these
#                          launchers can verify a session on
#   ol_session_open        the runtime's `create`, through overseer-host
#   ol_record_*            the session record in the oversee state's
#                          `overseer` object: read, written before the first
#                          turn, restored when the launch is abandoned, the
#                          pending successor written apart from it, and the
#                          current session's launch identity read back
#   ol_session_verify      the account read, the first working turn and the
#                          confirming read, inside one deadline

# Verification: the account the session is REALLY on, asked TWICE, and only
# the second answers.
#
# /proc/<pid>/environ is a snapshot taken at execve, so it shows what a process
# was handed, never what a process has since decided. A wrapper that sets the
# account and only then execs the harness carries the value it was given for as
# long as it runs, and a reading taken while it runs is a reading about the
# wrapper. Waiting for that value to settle does not fix this: it settles
# perfectly well on the pre-exec value.
#
# So the FIRST read is an early abort and nothing else. It can prove a
# disagreement that is already true, and proving one there is worth doing,
# because it comes before the session has had a turn in which to open a
# work-item window or write to the tracker on an account nobody picked. It
# cannot prove agreement, so it reports none.
#
# The SECOND read, taken once the session has shown a running turn, is the one
# that speaks and the one a predecessor is stopped on. A running turn is the
# harness itself; whatever exec was going to happen has happened.
#
# What is still not caught: a wrapper that execs onto another account AFTER the
# session reported a running turn and after this read settled. Nothing local
# can rule that out, since no reading proves a future exec.
#
