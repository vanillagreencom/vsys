# The steps every overseer launch takes, whoever asks for one: `oversee
# launch` opening a fleet's first overseer, and `oversee-succeed` opening a
# successor in a predecessor's place. One launcher, so a first launch and a
# succession cannot come to open, verify or record a session differently.
# What differs between them is policy and stays with the caller: which marks
# fire and which entries the account walk tries; the walk and the flag
# assembly apply that policy the same way for both. `oversee-watch` sources
# it too, through lib/watch-overseer-record.sh, for OL_JQ_DEFS, ol_preference,
# ol_session_inspect and ol_fleet_log. What is shared is here:
#
#   ol_preference          the ORCH_OVERSEER_PREFERENCE value, its default
#                          where the setting is unset
#   ol_preference_entries  the shared overseer and lane preference parse
#   ol_account             the account a session spends, as `lanes` judges it
#   ol_pi_model            a pi session's model, out of the sources naming it
#   ol_entry_model         one entry's harness, model and effort, as written
#   ol_lanes               `lanes` on this machine's copy of each account
#   ol_pick_record         one `lanes pick --json` record, for a caller's
#                          own counts
#   ol_pick_lane           one `lanes pick` for one entry, with the counts a
#                          refusal reports
#   ol_account_id          an account directory as its comparable identity
#   ol_walk                the account walk: the entries in order, the first
#                          whose lane qualifies, a predecessor's own entry and
#                          the rules a succession skips an entry on included
#   ol_entry_permitted     whether an entry's harness takes the posture its
#                          source allows
#   ol_launch_flags        the flag words of the entry the walk chose, a
#                          predecessor's words carried over as its harness
#                          and the entry's allow
#   ol_command_line        the harness command for a picked lane, brief
#                          included, made trusted and put under the lane form
#   ol_identity            the launch identity the next record write stores
#   ol_runtime_supported   the runtime resolved and held to the one these
#                          launchers can verify a session on
#   ol_checkout_sync       the checkout a session opens in fast-forwarded
#                          to its base branch's origin head, through
#                          sync-base, before the session opens there
#   ol_checkout_notice     a sync's refusal as the caller's keyed line, on
#                          stderr and in the fleet log
#   ol_session_open        the runtime's `create`, through overseer-host
#   ol_record_*            the session record in the oversee state's
#                          `overseer` object: read, written before the first
#                          turn, restored when the launch is abandoned, the
#                          pending successor written apart from it, the
#                          current session's launch identity read back, and
#                          a record lacking a fact its session knows healed
#   ol_session_verify      the account read, the first working turn and the
#                          confirming read, inside one deadline
#   ol_session_inspect     the runtime's `inspect` of a recorded session: its
#                          liveness, window, server and state
#   ol_succession          one succession from the pending record to the
#                          committing stop, the caller's words at each step
#   ol_session_stop        the runtime's `stop`
#   ol_session_abandon     the close-out every refusal after `create` takes:
#                          the session stopped, the prior record put back
#   ol_fleet_log           one `close` row about the overseer in the fleet log
#   ol_fleet_log_notice    one keyed line of the caller's as that row
#
# Every function returns 0 for the answer its name promises and 1 for a
# refusal the caller prints, with the reason in OL_REASON and its fields in
# the OL_* variables each function documents; none of them prints a keyed
# line of its own, save ol_preference_entries' deprecation warning, because
# the caller owns its own refusal prefix and words: ol_checkout_notice and
# ol_fleet_log_notice print theirs through the caller's `message`. Every
# dependency writes its stderr to DEP_ERR, which the caller relays under its
# keyed line.
#
# Requires, of a caller that runs its functions: SCRIPT_DIR (the orch scripts

# for ol_command_line to write, whether it is a first launch or a successor:
# MODEL and EFFORT written from HARNESS's row of lib/lane-launch.sh's table,
# then SOURCE's words FLAG... as HARNESS may take them, the predecessor's
# harness and flags, both empty on a first launch. An entry with neither
# MODEL nor EFFORT keeps every predecessor word. A numeric first-launch
# entry names EFFORT alone. One of the same harness strips
# the predecessor's model and effort and keeps its permission words exactly.
# One of another harness, a first launch among them, writes HARNESS's
# full-bypass permission words and keeps no predecessor word at all: its
# posture must transfer (launch_choice_permission_transferable), and every
# other word is spelled for the predecessor's CLI, a run-mode word such as
# copilot's `--autopilot` or a count beside it among them. The words
# kept are led by the harness's launch settings, the compaction words for the
# model the launch runs (MODEL, else the one the kept words name, else

# ol_command_line HARNESS HANDOFF LANE_DIR LAUNCH_DIR FLAG... — the whole
# command the session runs, into OL_CMD: the harness, FLAG... each quoted,
# and the brief naming HANDOFF; OL_LANE_VAR is the account variable the
# harness reads, OL_LAUNCH_HOME the home the launch runs under and OL_FORM
# the form the lane reaches the harness by (lib/lane-launch.sh). OL_IDENTITY
# is the launch identity the command carries (ol_identity), the model and
# effort read out of FLAG... by lib/lane-launch.sh's own readers, a pi model
# with the provider a split `--provider` word names, so the
# record a launch writes names what the line runs and nothing a caller
# restated beside it. An identity jq could not build is left empty, which the
# record writers refuse as their own step rather than record as unknown.
#
# The brief crosses the pane's shell inside single quotes, so it holds only
# shell-inert characters, and HANDOFF is held to the same alphabet by every
# caller. One plain sentence on claude and codex, the contract each of them
# already reads as its opening prompt; pi opens on its skill command, as
# open-terminal's pi lane brief does. The account variable is
# lib/lane-launch.sh § lane_env_prefix's for the harness and the model FLAG...
# names: pi's is claude's, which the pi-claude bridge reads, and
# PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR on the Copilot pool. An empty LANE_DIR, which ol_walk
# hands on for a pi model on a provider no lane measures (ol_pick_lane),
# launches the command bare.
#
# A codex session reads folder trust for LAUNCH_DIR before it reads its own
# arguments, and the pane it opens in has nobody at it, so the entry is made
# through the builder `open-terminal` uses; a launch whose entry could not be
# made returns 1 with OL_REASON=launch-trust-missing, the builder's reason
# in OL_TRUST_REASON and its dependency's own words, where the refusal has
# any, in DEP_ERR for the caller's refusal to print, rather than opening on
# the question. The lane reaches
# the harness through the same builder too: on a host whose `claude` is an
# account shim, an env prefix in front of it is overwritten for the shim's
# own name and the session starts on the bare account with nothing on screen
# saying so.
#
# The brief is a positional prompt on claude and codex; copilot takes it as
# the value of `-i`, which starts the interactive session and submits it.

# is the start ol_session_start printed for that session's server, empty
# where it could not be read: ol_names names the session only on the server
# started at the record's `server_start`, since after a tmux restart a new
# server may be handed the recorded pid and numbers its panes from %0 again,
# and never from a record carrying no start. ol_record_current, the
# generation bump, the exit writes and oversee-watch's identification take
# that strict answer; `oversee launch` takes it beside ol_owns for its
# liveness refusal.
# `ol_unstarted($server; $session)` is a record naming that session on that
# server with no start at all, which no current writer leaves but a record
# written before starts were recorded, or put back whole by
# ol_record_restore, still is. The session in that pane is the one the
# record was written for. The lane-mail-check hook's identification and
# lane-mail's peer reader ask it rather than read an empty start.
# `ol_owns($server; $start; $session)` is either answer: the record is that
# session's, bound or unstarted. Its readers are the two writers that bind an
# unstarted record to its session instead of reading it as another
# session's: the watch start (lib/watch-overseer-record.sh §
# overseer_command_record), which keeps its launch identity, and
# ol_record_heal, which the lane-mail-check hook runs from the overseer's
# turn ends and tool calls; `oversee launch` reads it for its liveness
# refusal, so a live pane a startless record names blocks a second overseer.

# succession the predecessor still runs in that checkout, waiting on its
# succession call, or is dead or walled. A succession abandoned after the
# sync leaves the predecessor on the fast-forwarded tree, as a `sync-base`
# run there after a merge does, and the launcher that called it, its own
# source already loaded, calls the moved helpers for the rest of its run. The
# checkout must have the base branch checked out, since `sync-base` moves
# that branch wherever it is checked out, or its ref where it is checked out
# nowhere, and would leave a tree on any other branch where it stands.
#
# `sync-base` runs under ORCH_OVERSEER_SYNC_TIMEOUT_S seconds, 60 by
# default, which the github skill's kendex_github_run_bounded holds. Its
# fetch never prompts for a credential and gives up on an HTTP transfer
# slower than 1000 bytes a second for 30 seconds. An origin that stalls is

# which runs a launch with no bound of its own, still opens a successor.

# ol_succession PREDECESSOR CWD LINE IDENTITY PENDING LANE_VAR LANE_DIR FORM
# WAIT_SECS — one succession, from the successor's first record write to the
# commit point, whichever launcher runs it: `oversee launch --predecessor` and
# `oversee-succeed` in every mode that launches (succeed, walled and dead). In
# order:
#   1. With PENDING `pending`, LINE and IDENTITY become the record's pending
#      successor (ol_record_pending); `replay`, a relaunch of the line the
#      record already holds, writes none.
#   2. The checkout CWD lies in is fast-forwarded (ol_checkout_sync); one it
#      refuses is the caller's `checkout-unsynced` line on stderr and in the
#      fleet log (ol_checkout_notice), and the launch goes on. The runtime's
#      `create` then opens LINE in CWD at the session's base index.
#   3. The record names the successor (ol_record_write over OL_PRIOR), where
#      the caller's ol_record_read could read one.
#   4. The session is verified (ol_session_verify, LANE_VAR to WAIT_SECS).
#   5. The predecessor is stopped with the successor keeping the base index: the
#      commit point, so HUP, INT and TERM are ignored from here on, and a
#      caller running in the predecessor's own window ends with it.
# The step order is this function's; what a failed record write at step 1 or
# 3 means is the caller's policy. The caller defines ol_succession_hook STEP,
# called at each point it speaks: `pending-unrecorded` and `record-unwritten`
# with the writer's words in DEP_ERR, where a nonzero return refuses the
# succession before its commit point and 0 lets it go on; `opened` once
# OL_SESSION and OL_WINDOW name the successor; and `verified` just before the
# commit point, for its notices and whatever it arranges before its window may
# end. Returns 0 once committed, and 1 with OL_REASON record-unwritten and
# OL_STEP pending or write where the hook refused, create-failed at step 2,
# ol_session_verify's reasons at step 4 and stop-failed at step 5, the

# (../schemas/workflow-state.md), which names the runtime, the server, the

# turn-end hook, the watch and `oversee launch` read it to know which session
# is the overseer, so during a succession it is what tells the predecessor and
# the successor apart, and a launch that is abandoned puts the predecessor's
# record back.
#
# The same object carries the current session's launch identity: its harness,
# account, home, model, effort and working directory. Its `pending` member is
# the successor a succession is about to open, written before that launch and
# never read as the current session's identity: a pending command names the
# account and model the NEXT session will run, and judging this one against

# already read it under, and `session_rows` names the file that pane's own
# event rows land in (lib/session-rows.sh), under the overseer mailbox of the
# checkout the session starts in, IDENTITY's `cwd`, or this launcher's own
# where that is unknown, and `server_start` is the server's start time read
# off that pane (lib/tmux-server.sh § tmux_server_start), so no start of
# another server's survives. A start that cannot be read writes nothing: a

# Verification: the account the session is REALLY on, asked TWICE, and only

#
# /proc/<pid>/environ is a snapshot taken at execve, so it shows what a process
# was handed, never what a process has since decided. A wrapper that sets the
# account and only then execs the harness carries the value it was given for as
# long as it runs, and a reading taken while it runs is a reading about the
# wrapper. Waiting for that value to settle does not fix this: it settles
# perfectly well on the pre-exec value.
#
# So the FIRST read is an early abort and nothing else. It can prove a
# disagreement that is already true, and proving one there is worth doing,
# because it comes before the session has had a turn in which to open a
# work-item window or write to the tracker on an account nobody picked. It
# cannot prove agreement, so it reports none.
#
# The SECOND read, taken once the session has shown a running turn, is the one
# that speaks and the one a predecessor is stopped on. A running turn is the
# harness itself; whatever exec was going to happen has happened.
#
# What is still not caught: a wrapper that execs onto another account AFTER the
# session reported a running turn and after this read settled. Nothing local
# can rule that out, since no reading proves a future exec.
#
# One deadline covers all three waits, and ol_budget_raw is that deadline:
