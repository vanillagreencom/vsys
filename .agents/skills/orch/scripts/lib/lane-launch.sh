# The one answer to "how does a resolved lane reach the launched harness, and
# is the pane really running it". Every launcher that starts a harness on a
# chosen account builds its command here — open-terminal for a work item,
# oversee-succeed for a successor overseer — so a second builder cannot drift
# from the first and launch onto an account nobody picked.
#
# Sourced, never run.

# lane_account_check below compares two config dirs through lane_claims_canon,
# the one normaliser for a lane path. A caller that had not sourced that sibling
# would run both comparisons as an absent command, and two DIFFERENT accounts
# would compare equal as the empty string — the guard reporting `verified` for
# the very disagreement it exists to catch. The dependency is this file's, so
# this file takes it. That sibling sets `set -euo pipefail` as it loads, so a
# caller that must stay errexit-free restores its own posture after sourcing
# this file, the way `lanes` already does at its lib seam.
# shellcheck source=lane-claims.sh
source "$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)/lane-claims.sh"

# lane_codex_trust_prepare below reads a codex config.toml for one key and
# writes it back without one table. That reading is shared with `spawn-adapter`,
# which asks the same file a different question, so it lives in its own library
# and both callers source it rather than each carrying a scanner of its own.
# shellcheck source=toml.sh

# The private home the preparation below builds is named by lane-home.sh, which
# also takes such a path back apart for the readers outside this launch that ask
# which account a session is spending.

# The env prefix that puts a launch on a chosen account: the harness names the

# launchers that render it into a command — so a harness added to one of them
# cannot go on being prefixed with the other harness's variable, which starts it
# on whatever account that harness defaults to with nothing on screen saying so.
#
# Codex is named and every other harness takes the Claude variable, which is

# measures claude and codex only and produces no third value here. A harness

# How each harness spells the two choices a lane launch must make, for every
# caller that READS a launch's flags and every caller that WRITES them: the
# launcher that refuses a launch naming neither, and the successor builder in
# `oversee-succeed` that renders them. Stated here once, in the file that owns
# per-harness launch mapping, so a harness that renames its effort flag cannot
# leave one copy behind and have the launcher refuse every launch of it while
# the builder writes the old word.
#
# One row per harness,
# `HARNESS|MODEL SPELLINGS|EFFORT SPELLINGS|EFFORT-IN-MODEL|ATTACH WORD`, each
# spelling list space-separated, so a consumer's harness or a new flag spelling
# is one row rather than a code path. A spelling that ends in `=` is a whole
# token with its value attached; any other is a flag word taking the next token
# or an attached `=VALUE`. `-` as the effort list is a harness whose launch form
# has no effort flag, and such a launch names the model alone. The fourth field
# is the separator that attaches the effort to the model VALUE where the harness
# accepts it there, `-` where it does not; a launch using that form has named
# both choices in one token. The fifth is the flag word an attached-value
# spelling rides on when one is WRITTEN — codex's `-c` carries the whole
# `model_reasoning_effort=` token — and `-` where the effort is a plain flag
# word that takes its value as the next one.
#
# The FIRST spelling of each list is the one written; the rest are further
# spellings a caller may have typed, which launch_choice_value reads.
#
# Read out of each harness's own help, never from memory:
#   claude    `claude --help`: `--model <model>`, `--effort <level>`.
#   codex     `codex --help`: `-m, --model <MODEL>`; reasoning effort is a
#             config override, `-c, --config <key=value>` carrying the
#             `model_reasoning_effort` key, so the whole token is the spelling.
#   opencode  the flags table of `opencode [project]`, the form start_cmd
#             renders: `--model, -m`, and no effort flag at all. `--variant`
#             belongs to `opencode run`, which this script never launches.
#   pi        `pi --help`: `--model <pattern>` "supports provider/id and optional
#             `:<thinking>`", `--thinking <level>`. The colon form is the fourth
#             field: `--model sonnet:high` names the level pi will run at, so a
#             launch passing it has made the effort choice and is not asked for
#             it again.

# The ONE decision about how a resolved lane reaches the launched harness, made
# once per launch and read both by the launch line and by the account check that
# follows the pane open. Prints one of:
#   launcher:<path>  launch through that file, with no env prefix
#   prefix           launch under the env prefix, and check the pane
#   unchecked        launch under the env prefix where a lane was resolved;
#                    nothing of ours to check either way
#
# A LAUNCHER is a command named for the lane's own config directory — its
# basename without the leading dot — which selects the account itself. Where one
# exists it is the WHOLE selector and the prefix is dropped: such a wrapper
# exports the lane variable for its OWN name, so under `env VAR=<picked> claude`
# it overwrites the prefix and the lane runs on another account with nothing on
# screen saying so. The config directory's basename, never a lane alias: an
# operator can rename a lane to `work`, and no `work` command exists. The name
# is derived the way `lanes` derives its own, `basename --` then the leading
# dot, so every spelling that reaches `lanes` reaches this judge identically.
# `${dir##*/}` is not that: a trailing slash, which `--lane` and an
# ORCH_LANE_DIRS entry both carry through unnormalised, strips the whole value
# and leaves no name to judge. One normalisation, not a case per spelling.
#
# An absolute, executable path only, so a shell builtin sharing the lane's name
# is not mistaken for a wrapper. That path is also what gets RENDERED, quoted.
# A bare word in the launch line is resolved AGAIN by the pane's own shell, and
# a tmux server started before a PATH change or a login shell that reorders PATH
# resolves a different file or none while the env prefix has already been
# dropped — the function judging one file and the pane running another. An
# absolute path leaves the wrapper's own account selection intact, since it
# reads its invocation name and `${0##*/}` of `/…/bin/1claude` is `1claude`.
#
# The name must CARRY the harness word and not BE it. The harness binary is the
# thing being configured, never a configurator: `claude` for a lane at
# `~/.claude` or `<dir>/accounts/claude`, and `codex` for one at
# `~/.config/codex`, would select that harness's own default account while the
# dropped prefix stopped selecting anything. A name belonging to the OTHER
# harness is the same mistake pointed elsewhere — a lane and a harness are
# chosen independently, so a codex lane launched under claude would otherwise
# render `1codex` running claude's arguments. Both fall through to the prefix
# form, which selected these lanes correctly all along.
#
# Local claude and codex launches only, which the caller establishes before it
# asks: a launch on another machine answers about the wrong PATH, and
# CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR and CODEX_HOME are those two harnesses' own variables. A
# rendered command that does not open on the harness word has no first word to
# replace, so it keeps the prefix — which the account check still verifies.
#
# TEMPLATE non-empty says the command is the CALLER'S own, from a --cmd
# template, whose first word is not ours to replace. It is an input to this
# judge rather than a tag a caller writes for itself, so every launch that ASKS
# gets its form from this one line. A launch that never asks — a hosted one,
# which runs on another machine and carries no local lane prefix — keeps
# whatever its caller initialised the form to, and is read back by nothing.

# An observation counts only once it SETTLES: two reads a second apart carrying

# the env-prefix form the launch child carries the picked value from its own
# execve until the wrapper's exec lands, and trusting that read would confirm an
# account the pane is about to stop running.
#
# Settling proves repetition, never that the exec has landed. /proc/<pid>/environ
# is written at execve, so a wrapper slower than the settle window carries the
# value it was handed throughout and two agreeing reads agree about the wrapper.
# Only the caller can close that gap, by asking once the harness is certainly
# what answers: once the pane draws the harness's own screen, or once it shows a
# running turn — pane_harness_up in lib/lane-state.sh is that question.
