# The one answer to "how does a resolved lane reach the launched harness, and
# is the pane really running it". Every launcher that starts a harness on a
# chosen account builds its command here — open-terminal for a work item,
# oversee-succeed for a successor overseer — so a second builder cannot drift
# from the first and launch onto an account nobody picked.
#
# Sourced, never run.

# lane_account_check below compares two config dirs through lane_claims_canon,
# the one normaliser for a lane path. A caller that had not sourced that sibling
# would run both comparisons as an absent command, and two DIFFERENT accounts
# would compare equal as the empty string — the guard reporting `verified` for
# the very disagreement it exists to catch. The dependency is this file's, so
# this file takes it. That sibling sets `set -euo pipefail` as it loads, so a
# caller that must stay errexit-free restores its own posture after sourcing
# this file, the way `lanes` already does at its lib seam.
# shellcheck source=lane-claims.sh
source "$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)/lane-claims.sh"

# The codex arm of lane_trust_prepare below reads a codex config.toml for one
# key and writes it back without one table. That reading is shared with `spawn-adapter`,
# which asks the same file a different question, so it lives in its own library
# and both callers source it rather than each carrying a scanner of its own.
# shellcheck source=toml.sh

# which account a session is spending.

# The env prefix that puts a launch on a chosen account: the harness names the
# variable, the directory IS the account. One mapping for every caller — the
# chooser in `lanes` that hands a picked lane back as a prefix, and the
# launchers that render it into a command — so a harness added to one of them
# cannot go on being prefixed with the other harness's variable, which starts it
# on whatever account that harness defaults to with nothing on screen saying so.
#
# Codex and Copilot are named. A Pi launch on the Copilot pool
# (lane_pick_harness below) takes Pi's own variable, PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR, the
# directory whose Pi login spends that pool, as lane-host-ssh gives a hosted Pi
# lane. Every other harness takes the Claude variable, which is what a local
# `--lane` launch on a further harness has always done. A Pi launch on a
# `pi-claude/` model is one of them: pi-claude-bridge runs Claude Code on the
# credential CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR names, so that variable IS the Claude seat it
# spends, and a Pi lane named on a Claude config dir is never handed that dir as
# its Pi root. A harness added to this repository adds its arm HERE.
#
# COPILOT_HOME is Copilot's one account variable: it moves the whole config
# root, settings, state and login list alike, so the directory IS the account
# there as it is for the other two.

# How each harness spells the two choices a lane launch must make, for every
# caller that READS a launch's flags and every caller that WRITES them: the
# launcher that refuses a launch naming neither, and the successor builder in
# `oversee-succeed` that renders them. Stated here once, in the file that owns
# per-harness launch mapping, so a harness that renames its effort flag cannot
# leave one copy behind and have the launcher refuse every launch of it while
# the builder writes the old word.
#
# One row per harness,
# `HARNESS|MODEL SPELLINGS|EFFORT SPELLINGS|EFFORT-IN-MODEL|ATTACH WORD|
# PERMISSION SPELLINGS|TRANSFER PERMISSION SPELLINGS|LAUNCH SETTINGS|
# QUESTION TOOL OFF|COMPACTION OFF`, each
# spelling list space-separated, so a consumer's harness or a new flag spelling
# is one row rather than a code path. A spelling that ends in `=` is a whole
# token with its value attached; any other is a flag word taking the next token
# or an attached `=VALUE`. `-` as the effort list is a harness whose launch form
# has no effort flag, and such a launch names the model alone. The fourth field
# is the separator that attaches the effort to the model VALUE where the harness
# accepts it there, `-` where it does not; a launch using that form has named
# both choices in one token. The fifth is the flag word an attached-value
# spelling rides on when one is WRITTEN — codex's `-c` carries the whole
# `model_reasoning_effort=` token — and `-` where the effort is a plain flag
# word that takes its value as the next one. The sixth field is every permission
# posture an unattended launch accepts. The seventh is the subset whose full
# bypass meaning can transfer between harnesses. Its first spelling is written;
# a `FLAG=VALUE` spelling also accepts `FLAG VALUE` when a caller supplied it.
# `-` says the harness launch form has no permission word in that set. The
# eighth is the launch-only settings every command a launcher builds for that
# harness carries, written as they stand, one `;`-separated run per setting, and
# `-` where it has none. Codex
# checks for a newer CLI on startup and opens an interactive update prompt when
# one exists; the first paste a lane receives then answers that prompt, installs
# the update and exits the session. `check_for_update_on_startup=false` is the
# key the Codex config reference names for centrally managed installs, passed
# per launch so no installed config is edited. `features.daemon_auto_start=false`
# keeps these embedded launches from warning about the shared background server;
# `-c` also accepts an unknown feature on older Codex builds.
# `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`, documented at
# https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks#review-and-trust-hooks, replaces the
# per-hook `trusted_hash` entries the local route cannot keep current.
# These settings ride local and hosted commands and overseer successions.
# The ninth is the words that take
# the harness question tool away, written as they stand, and `-` where this
# table names none. A lane asks its overseer through `lane-mail ask`, and a
# question tool in a lane opens a dialog nobody at the pane answers, so every
# lane command carries its row's words where the row has any; a launched
# overseer carries them as launch_overseer_question_tool below decides from
# ORCH_QUESTION_TOOL.
# The tenth holds the harness compaction
# policy settings; `-` means no launch setting. Claude reads DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT
# from --settings. Codex defers normal compaction to its reported usable-window
# cap; it can still compact between external handoff checks or on other paths.
# references/skill-rules.md, Compaction, cites the verified runtime contract.
# Pi uses its settings file, which open-terminal reads instead. Copilot's
# flags and `copilot help config` (1.0.88) name no switch that turns its
# automatic compaction off, so its row has none.
#
# The FIRST spelling of each list is the one written; the rest are further
# spellings a caller may have typed, which launch_choice_value reads.
#
# Read out of each harness's own help, never from memory:
#   claude    `claude --help`: `--model <model>`, `--effort <level>`,
#             `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; `--permission-mode`
#             `bypassPermissions|dontAsk` are accepted permission forms.
#   codex     `codex --help`: `-m, --model <MODEL>`; reasoning effort is a
#             config override, `-c, --config <key=value>` carrying the
#             `model_reasoning_effort` key, so the whole token is the spelling;
#             `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, `--approve-for-me`
#             and `-a, --ask-for-approval` name unattended permission modes.
#             `check_for_update_on_startup` is not in `codex --help`: it is a
#             top-level key in the Codex config reference, which `-c` sets.
#   opencode  the flags table of `opencode [project]`, the form start_cmd
#             renders: `--model, -m`, and no effort flag at all. `--variant`
#             belongs to `opencode run`, which this script never launches.
#   pi        `pi --help`: `--model <pattern>` "supports provider/id and optional
#             `:<thinking>`", `--thinking <level>`. The colon form is the fourth
#             field: `--model sonnet:high` names the level pi will run at, so a
#             launch passing it has made the effort choice and is not asked for
#             it again.
#   copilot   `copilot --help` (1.0.88): `--model <model>`, `--reasoning-effort
#             <level>` with none, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh and max;
#             `--allow-all` and `--yolo` each equal `--allow-all-tools
#             --allow-all-paths --allow-all-urls`, and `--allow-all-tools`
#             alone is the permission the non-interactive mode requires. Only
#             the two full spellings transfer: the tools-only word leaves paths
#             and URLs asking. `--autopilot` starts the session in autopilot
#             mode, which sends the session continuation messages of its own,
#             as many as `--max-autopilot-continues <count>` allows, 5 by
#             default. `--context long_context` selects the 1M window where
#             the default is about 200K, so the handoff's 400000-token cap
#             comes before the automatic compaction Copilot starts at about 80
#             percent of the window, and `--no-auto-update` keeps a newer CLI
#             from installing itself under a running lane. All are launch
#             settings, carried by every command built here, a resume
#             included, named on the command rather than left to the
#             account's settings file, whose defaultMode and
#             defaultPermissionMode a resumed session ignores (`copilot help
#             config`): nobody sits at a lane's pane to answer a turn that
#             stopped short, and 3 bounds what such a stop, or a turn ended to
#             wait on the lane's mailbox monitor, spends of the account's
#             pool. `-i <prompt>` starts the interactive session and submits
#             the prompt, and `--resume=<id>` resumes a session by its id;
#             open-terminal's start_cmd renders both. The rest of what every
#             copilot command carries is environment, lane_copilot_env below.
# The question-tool words, measured on the same installs:
#   claude    `claude --help`: `--disallowedTools <tools...>`, comma or space
#             separated. Variadic, so the words are one `=` token: a bare
#             value list would take the kickoff prompt after it as one more
#             tool name. AskUserQuestion asks; EnterPlanMode ends in the plan
#             approval dialog.
#   codex     `codex --help`: `-c features.<name>=false`, which `--disable
#             <FEATURE>` equals. `request_user_input` reaches the model in
#             Default mode only under the `default_mode_request_user_input`
#             feature, and Plan mode is the person's own switch; the feature
#             is disabled so a CLI that turns it on by default changes nothing
#             here. The `-c` form, because `--disable` refuses a feature name
#             the CLI does not know and `-c` sets it silently: a codex build
#             without the feature still starts.
#   pi        `pi --help`: `--exclude-tools <tools>`, which applies to
#             extension tools; `question` is the tool pi-questions registers.
#   opencode  its `question` tool is a permission, and the one per-launch
#             switch its docs name is the OPENCODE_PERMISSION environment
#             variable, JSON no flag word carries: the row names none, and an
#             opencode lane keeps its question tool.
#   copilot   `copilot --help`: `--no-ask-user` disables the ask_user tool, the
#             clarifying question the CLI otherwise asks at the pane.

You reach your overseer through your branch and pull request and nothing else. Where .agents/skills/commit-guards/scripts/install-git-hooks is present, arm the commit hooks with it before your first commit. Where it is not, commit anyway, since the pull request CI, the review gate and the second-opinion gate hold the merge. Then, before any other work, make your first commit with git commit --allow-empty, push it to {branch}, and open a draft pull request from {branch}: your overseer reads an item branch with no open pull request soon after launch as a lane that never started, and GitHub opens none on a branch with no commit ahead of its base. While the work goes on, and while a blocker stands, keep the pull request draft, with where the work stands and any blocker under a ## Lane status heading in its body, and name a blocker in a pull request comment too. When the work is done, mark the pull request ready for review. Never ask a question: a step that needs an answer is a step this lane never takes, so name the blocker in the pull request and end your turn. Never run linear.sh, lane-mail or pr-merge, never arm a background wake, and never wait on a person.'

# shared fleet render on every launch, so an entry written there is gone by the
# next launch and is visible to no fixture. The launch therefore builds a
# CODEX_HOME OF ITS OWN under the account, holding the account's own files by
# link and one config.toml of its own carrying the account's config plus the
# entry. For claude the config dir's `.claude.json` is the account's own
# state, the file the harness itself writes the answer given at the pane
# into, so the entry is written there, in the pair the harness records for
# that answer: the same pair tools/harness-smoke seeds a harness home with,
# and the one the lane-host provider merges key by key from the
# operator-staged ACCOUNT/lane-host/.claude.json for a hosted lane.

# The ONE decision about how a resolved lane reaches the launched harness, made
# once per launch and read both by the launch line and by the account check that
# follows the pane open. Prints one of:
#   launcher:<path>  launch through that file, with no env prefix
#   prefix           launch under the env prefix, and check the pane
#   unchecked        launch under the env prefix where a lane was resolved;
#                    nothing of ours to check either way
#
# A LAUNCHER is a command named for the lane's own config directory — its
# basename without the leading dot — which selects the account itself. Where one
# exists it is the WHOLE selector and the prefix is dropped: such a wrapper
# exports the lane variable for its OWN name, so under `env VAR=<picked> claude`
# it overwrites the prefix and the lane runs on another account with nothing on
# screen saying so. The config directory's basename, never a lane alias: an
# operator can rename a lane to `work`, and no `work` command exists. The name
# is derived the way `lanes` derives its own, `basename --` then the leading
# dot, so every spelling that reaches `lanes` reaches this judge identically.
# `${dir##*/}` is not that: a trailing slash, which `--lane` and an
# ORCH_LANE_DIRS entry both carry through unnormalised, strips the whole value
# and leaves no name to judge. One normalisation, not a case per spelling.
#
# An absolute, executable path only, so a shell builtin sharing the lane's name
# is not mistaken for a wrapper. That path is also what gets RENDERED, quoted.
# A bare word in the launch line is resolved AGAIN by the pane's own shell, and
# a tmux server started before a PATH change or a login shell that reorders PATH
# resolves a different file or none while the env prefix has already been
# dropped — the function judging one file and the pane running another. An
# absolute path leaves the wrapper's own account selection intact, since it
# reads its invocation name and `${0##*/}` of `/…/bin/1claude` is `1claude`.
#
# The name must CARRY the harness word and not BE it. The harness binary is the
# thing being configured, never a configurator: `claude` for a lane at
# `~/.claude` or `<dir>/accounts/claude`, and `codex` for one at
# `~/.config/codex`, would select that harness's own default account while the
# dropped prefix stopped selecting anything. A name belonging to the OTHER
# harness is the same mistake pointed elsewhere — a lane and a harness are
# chosen independently, so a codex lane launched under claude would otherwise
# render `1codex` running claude's arguments. Both fall through to the prefix
# form, which selected these lanes correctly all along.
#
# Local claude, codex and copilot launches only, which the caller establishes
# before it asks: a launch on another machine answers about the wrong PATH,
# and CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, CODEX_HOME and COPILOT_HOME are those harnesses' own
# variables. A rendered command that does not open on the harness word has no
# first word to replace, so it keeps the prefix — which the account check
# still verifies. A Copilot launcher such as `1copilot` exports COPILOT_HOME
# for its own name exactly as the others do.
#
# TEMPLATE non-empty says the command is the CALLER'S own, from a --cmd
# template, whose first word is not ours to replace. It is an input to this
# judge rather than a tag a caller writes for itself, so every launch that ASKS
# gets its form from this one line. A launch that never asks — a hosted one,

# A wrapper on PATH exports the lane variable for its own name, so a launch can
# be running on an account nobody picked while the claim recorded for it counts
# against the picked one and nothing on screen says so.
#
# The guard fails closed on what it OBSERVES and never on what it could not: an
# observed disagreement returns 1 and the caller closes the window, while an
# ORCH_LANE_SETTLE_MS out of range, no readable per-process environment, no
# pane pid, a broken descendant probe and no descendant carrying the variable
# inside the bound each return 0 with the reason named, and leave a healthy
# lane running.
#
# The outcome is one tagged value in LANE_ACCOUNT_RESULT, which every caller
# matches to choose its own message: `skipped`, `verified`, `mismatch`, or
# `unobserved:<reason>`. LANE_ACCOUNT_OBSERVED carries the dir it settled on.
#
# BOUND is how many seconds the caller gives the reading to settle, never below
# LANE_SETTLE_MIN_SECS above.
#
# An observation counts only once it SETTLES: two reads ORCH_LANE_SETTLE_MS
# apart carrying the same value. The first non-empty read is not the harness's answer — under
# the env-prefix form the launch child carries the picked value from its own
# execve until the wrapper's exec lands, and trusting that read would confirm an
# account the pane is about to stop running.
#
# Settling proves repetition, never that the exec has landed. /proc/<pid>/environ
# is written at execve, so a wrapper slower than the settle window carries the
# value it was handed throughout and two agreeing reads agree about the wrapper.
# Only the caller can close that gap, by asking once the harness is certainly
# what answers: once the pane draws the harness's own screen, or once it shows a
# running turn — pane_harness_up in lib/lane-state.sh is that question.
#
# The premise is the CALLER'S, and neither shipped caller treats it as proven.
# open-terminal waits for it best effort and, where the wait comes back empty,
# reports the reading that follows as unobserved rather than as a verified
# account. oversee-succeed's FIRST read is deliberately unpremised — it exists
# to catch a disagreement that is already true, before the successor has had a
# turn — and only its second read, taken once the pane shows a running turn,
# carries the premise and is the one its window closes on.
