# The rules a mailbox obeys wherever the file sits: the lane's own disk through
# `lane-mail`, a provider's host through `lane-host append`, and the fixture
# that models a provider. One owner for each, because a drift in where a line
# ends glues two envelopes together or hands over half of one, and a drift in
# the lock loses a line whenever two writers meet.
#
# Sourced, never executed, after lib/file-lock.sh, whose orch_take_lock and
# orch_release_lock this uses; oversee-watch sources it for the envelope class
# alone, which takes no lock. Bash 3.2-safe, like its callers.

# Whether FILE ends on a complete line: 0 when its last byte is a newline and
# when it is empty, 1 when a writer left a fragment there, 2 when it could not
# be read. Both sides of a mailbox ask this, the writer before it appends and
# the reader before it hands lines over, and a one-sided answer is how the two
# come apart: the writer glues two envelopes together, or the reader emits a
# partial line or drops a whole one.

# A writer killed inside its write leaves a line with no newline of its own.
# Closing it makes it a line the reader counts and does not parse, so the
# envelope that follows lands whole instead of being glued to it and both lost.

# kernel places at the end exactly as the caller's descriptor would.

# Add stdin's bytes to FILE under a lock on FILE itself, which every writer of
# it on that disk opens. A lock anywhere else is one writer's own: two writers
# holding separate locks both read the file and the second write loses the
# first one's line. FILE is created when it is not there, under whatever umask
# the caller set, and an unterminated last line is closed first.
#
# GUARD, where given, is a function run as `GUARD FILE` under the lock after
# the terminator and before the append: a check-and-append that is one
# operation, so a line whose right to land depends on what the file already
# holds, a delivery id or an ask's one resolution, is judged against the file
# it joins and never against a copy another writer has moved on from. The
# guard returning nonzero refuses the append as exit 4 and lands nothing; what
# it found is the guard's own to report.
#
# Exit 3 when the lock could not be taken within WAIT_SECONDS, 2 when a write
# failed, 4 when the guard refused. The three are different repairs, a writer
# holding the mailbox, a disk or permission failure, a line already there, so
# every caller turns the number into its own word before anyone reads it:
# lane-mail into lock-failed, write-failed and the guard's key, the provider
# and the fixture into lock-timeout and write-failed.
