#
# The ONE answer to "what is this lane doing right now", shared by every
# script that has to tell a working lane from a parked, walled, asking, dead
# or absent one. A caller left to invent its own answer invents a different
# one: the watch read the pane screen, `open-terminal --wake` read /proc, and
# the two disagreed about the same lane inside one minute.
#
# `lane_state` is the whole judge. Nothing else may classify a lane.
#
# Sourced, never run.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pane predicates. One line each, matched with `grep -E` against
# `pane_below_last_turn`'s slice — never the whole capture. The exception is a
# launcher proving a launch took on a window it opened seconds ago: that pane
# has no earlier turn to slice from, so pane_working and pane_trust_dialog are
# also read there against the whole capture, and each says so where it is used.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A turn in flight: the interrupt hint (both harnesses), the hint shown while
# a foreground shell runs, or the streaming token counter of the status line.
# Measured off running sessions of both harnesses.
#
# Deliberately NOT a spinner glyph. Claude Code animates one frame set
# (`· ✢ * ✶ ✻ ✽`) across every long-running screen, its OAuth sign-in
# included, so a spinner reads a lane parked at a login prompt as working;
# `·` is also its separator character and `*` is in its startup banner. `✻`
# additionally spells the idle end-of-turn line (`✻ Churned for 6s · done`),
# so it survives the turn that drew it exactly as `●` does. The token counter
# and the interrupt hint are drawn only while a turn is actually running.
#
# The counter appears a second or two INTO a turn, after streaming starts, so
# a turn caught in its first moments reads as not working. Callers that poll
# see it on a later pass; callers that must not act on a false negative say so
# where they read it.
#
# One more, measured off live Claude Code lanes. `Jump to bottom (ctrl+End) ↓`
# ends the frame of a pane scrolled up: the live turn is drawn below what is
# visible, so nothing on that screen can classify the lane, and an
# unclassifiable frame must never come back idle. The opening parenthesis of
# the key hint is matched with the words, so a transcript quoting the phrase
# in prose is not read as a scrolled frame; the key name is left out, since
# the hint differs by platform and a missed marker is the worse direction.
#
# Copilot CLI 1.0.88 draws `esc interrupt` in its footer while a command runs,
# the key drawn bold and the word after it plain, measured on a `!` shell
# command at the pane (fixtures/oversee-watch/copilot-working.txt). Its footer
# during a model turn is not measured; the same hint there is assumed, and a
# turn it does not draw reads as not working, the direction the counter's first
# seconds already take.

#   and always draws one of them below the transcript. So every Codex screen
#   ends in a live-input marker line, and its marker alone is the signature.
#   Copilot CLI 1.0.88 draws its composer as the marker and plain spaces,

#   measured. Its dialog rows sit inside a box border, never at column 0.
# The last marker line is the live input when it carries any of the four
# signatures; pane_below_last_turn holds the rest of the rule.
# Byte escapes, never `\u`: bash leaves a `\u` escape unexpanded in the C

#
# Both harnesses, deliberately: keyed on the Claude markers alone this answered

#   CMD      the pane's foreground process name, "" when it cannot be read
#   PID      the pane process id, "" when the child probe cannot run
#   SCREEN   the pane capture, whole
#   SESSION  `busy`, `idle` or `unjudged` from the harness process read
#            through /proc, and "" where the caller has no /proc to read
#   ACCOUNT  `room` where the caller measured the lane's account and found
#            the wall its banner reports lifted, `walled` where it found the
#            wall standing, and "" where it measured nothing
#   ROWS     for a Pi lane, lib/session-rows.sh § session_rows_lane_verdict's
#            word, `unreadable` where that read failed; "" for any other lane
#   HOSTED_ITEM and HARNESS name the remote process read through lane-host.
#            One call per invocation; a failure returns unjudged without
#            falling back to the local ssh child or the screen.
#   LANE_EXIT_SOURCE is `provider` for a confirmed remote exit, `pane` for
#            a childless local shell, and empty for every other verdict.
#
# A PI LANE IS JUDGED FROM WHAT PI EMITS, NEVER FROM ITS PANE, by every caller
# that passes ROWS: the Stop and PreToolUse rows the lane-mail-check hook
# writes under the pi-hooks carrier, which oversee-watch and `lanes state`
# pass. lane-close's close guard passes none, so it still reads a Pi lane's
# pane. Past `gone` and `exited`, which are the window and the process and no screen,
# ROWS answers `idle`, `working` or `walled` alone, under the same ACCOUNT and
# SESSION rules the pane rungs keep, and a lane with no row, or rows that could
# not be read, is `unjudged`. Pi's carrier sends no dialog event, so a Pi lane
# is never `asking`.
#
# THE PANE IS ASKED FIRST FOR EVERY RUNG THAT IS NOT `idle`, which the
# supplied process read decides; the session rule below carries that half.
# HOSTED_ITEM reads the remote harness first; SSH liveness cannot settle it.
#
# Rung order is load-bearing and is the order the watch has always used:
# `walled` outranks `asking` because a limit banner can sit above a stale
# prompt and the spent account is the news. A banner stays on the screen after
# its window resets, since a lane parked by it takes no turn to scroll it
# away, so an ACCOUNT of `room` passes the banner over and the rungs below
# answer; `walled` and "" keep it, and any other value is `unjudged`.
# `asking` outranks `working` because a dialog is up whatever the transcript
# above it is doing; and `idle` demands the absence of a turn in flight, so a
# working lane can never take that rung.
#
# THE WHOLE SESSION RULE, in one sentence: a SUPPLIED SESSION that is not
# `idle` answers on its own and the pane's `idle` rung is never reached, so a
# lane only comes back `idle` when every reader the caller has agrees it is.
# WORKING_RE appears a second or two into a turn, after streaming starts, so a
# turn's first moments are an input marker with nothing above it —
# indistinguishable on the screen from a finished turn. `open-terminal --wake`
# is the caller that acts on `idle`, by starting a second session on the lane's
# worktree, and the only one that supplies SESSION. A process read that cannot
# settle the question is `unjudged`, and treating that as agreement is what
# would wake a live lane. Codex publishes no idle signal, so the wake's reader
# answers `busy` for a codex process with a shell under it and `unjudged` for
# every other one it finds in the lane's worktree: such a lane is never woken
# while that process lives. A caller that supplies no SESSION keeps every
# answer the pane gives.
#
# An OUT_VAR rather than a printed word: the child probe's raw status is the
# caller's to report, and LANE_PROBE_RC set inside a command substitution
# would never leave that subshell. Every local carries the `_ls_` prefix so a
# caller may name its output variable anything without the assignment landing
# in one of them.
#
# Exit 2, with OUT_VAR set to `unjudged`, means a scan failed rather than
# answered. The caller decides whether that ends its run.

# Whether a lane's handoff record stands, as `workflow-state handoff-standing`
# answers it. That verb owns the test and publishes its verdict as the word on
# its first stdout line, exiting 0 for every verdict, so the word is read here
# and its status only says whether the run reached the verb: every orch script
# sources the project's `.env.local` before its dispatch, and a settings file
# that stops it exits with a status of its own and no verdict.

# lane_handoff_standing DIR ERR_FILE COMMAND... runs COMMAND, the verb's whole
# argv, from DIR with its stderr in ERR_FILE, and sets LANE_HANDOFF_STATE:
#   stands      a record no relaunch has resumed, its JSON in
#               LANE_HANDOFF_RECORD
#   none        no record stands, a state file that is not there included
#   unreadable  anything else: the verb's own `unreadable`, a run that never
#               reached the verb, a word it does not print, and a `stands`
#               with no record under it, which the verb never prints whole
# ERR_FILE holds the run's own words for the last; an empty ERR_FILE leaves
# them on the caller's own stderr, never reopened by path, since a redirect to
# /dev/stderr truncates a stderr that is a regular file. The watch that reports a
# record and the relaunch that retires a session both ask here; the lane-mail
# hook keeps a reader of its own, since it installs apart from these scripts.
