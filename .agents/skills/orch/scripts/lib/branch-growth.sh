# What a caller outside this package checks before it uses the measurement.
# A package installed at its own revision can be older than the caller beside
# it, and a call into a signature this library has not got yet does not fail:
# a missing function is `command not found` and an extra argument is dropped.
# So a caller checks this number is at least the one it needs, and nothing
# checks a ceiling: the number is ADDITIVE ONLY. Bump it when a cross-package
# entry point is added, or when an existing one gains an argument every older
# call still reads correctly without. An incompatible change to an existing
# entry point takes a NEW function name and a bump, never a new signature
# under the old name — an older caller would accept this number and then call
# the old spelling.

# The one git invocation every branch measurement reads, so callers score
# the same diffstat under the same rules. --find-renames is passed rather than
# left to the runner's diff.renames, which decides whether a move a size
# ratchet forced costs zero lines or twice the file. core.quotePath=false keeps
# a non-ASCII path literal: under the default git wraps it in double quotes and
# escapes the bytes, and the classifier compares whole paths, so a quoted
# tests/ path stops reading as a test and its lines are scored against the
# stricter production allowance. The base ref it compared against is left in
# BRANCH_GROWTH_BASE_REF for a caller that binds its verdict to the commits it
# measured.
#
# A caller that already knows the endpoint it is judging passes it as the fifth
# argument, and the base-branch lookup is skipped: the measurement is then of
# the range the caller named, never of whatever this checkout calls its default
# branch. An endpoint that does not resolve fails the measurement. Such a
# caller reaches no resolver and passes none, so $2 is empty there.

# Split the branch's added lines into production, test, and mandated render
# mirror lines. Additions alone are counted there, so a rewrite that moves
# lines earns no headroom from what it deleted. Test lines are counted apart
# because they answer to their own allowance, and a total that folds the two
# hides which one grew.
#
# The render-mirror roots come from branch_growth_render_roots, not from an
# argument: every caller of this measurement resolves one list, once. A render
# is counted once, at the source it renders, and the pairing is by path: strip
# a changed path's leading render-root segment and it is a mirror only when what remains
# names a source changed in the same diff — equal to that source's path without
# its final extension, or ending in it at a segment boundary when the source
# path has a directory of its own. The equal form covers a render whose
# extension differs from its source (a markdown agent rendered as a Codex
# toml); the suffix form covers a nested render root (a hook rendered under
# the Pi kendex directory). A root-level source takes only the equal form: by
# basename alone a root README would pair with every README under every
# render root. A render whose own source did not
# change pairs with nothing and is measured in full, and so is a render-only
# branch.
#
# $5, when the caller passes one, is the base endpoint the measurement runs
# against, replacing the base-branch lookup, and $2 is then unused and empty.
#
# $4 is the blank-separated list of extra test-path globs a repository adds to
# the built-in test rule. A pattern matches the whole repository-relative path,
# with `*` any run of characters including `/`, `?` any single character, and
# everything else literal. The list only adds: empty, or matching nothing, it
# leaves every line where the built-in rule put it, which for a path that rule
# does not name is production and the stricter allowance.
#
# The globs reach awk through the environment, not a `-v` assignment: awk
# processes escape sequences in a `-v` value before the program sees it, so a
# backslash in a configured glob would be rewritten, and rewritten differently
# by gawk and mawk. An ENVIRON entry arrives byte for byte.
