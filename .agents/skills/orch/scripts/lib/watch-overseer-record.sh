# The overseer's session record, as oversee-watch writes it at its start: the
# tail every oversee-succeed call carries, and the `overseer` object of the
# fleet state. Sourced by oversee-watch, and like the rest of its lib/ it
# reads that script's globals (HANDOFF, OVERSEER_FLAGS, WORKFLOW_STATE,
# WORKFLOW_STATE_ARGS, SUCCEED) and calls its `overseer_record_refuse` and
# `lane_context_caller_key`. Whether the record names this pane is
# lib/overseer-launch.sh's `ol_names`, the test its launchers write and read
# the record by.

# The tail every oversee-succeed call this watch makes carries: the handoff
# path the successor's brief must name, and the overseer's own flags after the
# `--` that ends that script's parser. Spelled here and nowhere else, because
# two sites ask for the same successor — the record of the line a death would
# replay, and the walled recovery that builds one now — and a flag added to
# one spelling and not the other is a successor launched two ways.
#
# An array rather than a printed list: a flag is one argv word whatever it
# holds, and a line-per-word rendering would split one carrying a newline into
# two. Never empty, so every call site expands it plainly.
