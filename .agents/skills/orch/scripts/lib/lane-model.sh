# The one answer to "what stands between this account and this launch". A lane
# picked on its binding bucket alone can still open on a model the account has
# no allowance left for, and the launch's first turn is a usage banner instead
# of a session.
#
# The jq program below is the whole answer, and `lanes` is its only judge:
# both of its pick forms — the fleet chooser and the single named lane — read
# `lane_binding` and the `wall_verdict` that classifies it from here, so the two
# cannot come to different conclusions about one account on one usage reading,
# nor can one of them know a verdict the other has no arm for.
# oversee-watch reads `lane_binding` too, for the reset a walled launch waits
# on, once `lanes pick` has judged the wall; it judges no wall of its own.
#
# Sourced, never run.

# model_binding($model) over one lane record: the bucket with the largest usage
# percentage that stands between this account and a launch on $model, or null
# where the record carries no window that answers. The answer keeps the bucket
# and reset beside the percentage so a refusal can name what made the decision.
#
# The 5-hour session and the plan-wide weekly window wall every model, so both
# always count, and so does a monthly pool: the Copilot credits a Copilot
# account, or a Pi launch on a `github-copilot/` model, spends are one pool for
# every model it names. A
# model-scoped weekly window walls only the model its own label names, so a
# launch on another model does not draw on it and it is left out — the
# difference between refusing an account that is free for this launch and
# launching one into a wall the binding bucket never showed.
#
# The label match is containment in either direction over the NORMALIZED
# spellings: case-folded, with every character that is not a letter or a digit
# dropped. An API label carries a version the caller's model id does not
# (`Fable 5.1` for `fable`), and a fully-spelled id carries a vendor and a
# generation the label does not (`claude-opus-5` for `Opus`).
#
# Dropping the separators is what lets a full model id reach its own window:
# `Fable 5.1` and `claude-fable-5-1` spell one model with different separators,
# and raw containment finds neither inside the other, so the scoped window is
# dropped and the account is judged on the session and weekly windows alone —
# the launch then opens on the very usage banner this file exists to prevent.
# Normalized, `fable51` sits inside `claudefable51`.
#
# Dropping them can also match one generation onto another (`Opus 5` inside
# `claude-opus-5-1`). That direction only ever adds a window to the judgement,
# so it refuses an account that might be free rather than launching one into a
# wall, which is the bias the unnamed-window rule below takes too.
#
# A label or model name with no letter or digit left matches nothing, since
# containment in an empty string is true of every string.
#
# A window with NO label counts for every model. The API omitted the name, so
# nothing says which model it is scoped to, and a window that might wall this
# launch is not evidence the launch is free. Skipping it would make naming a
# model more permissive than naming none: `pick` with no model still refuses
# such an account through its binding bucket.
#
# A record whose windows answer nothing yields null, which every caller must
# read as "not measured" and never as "free": wall_verdict below classifies
# such a lane unmeasured, and no caller picks it.
#
# No apostrophe ANYWHERE in the program below: it is one single-quoted shell
# word from the opening quote to the closing one, so an apostrophe at any depth
# ends the string there and hands jq a fragment.
