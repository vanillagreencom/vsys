# The fleet and account caps a fleet launch is judged on: the count, the two
# launch locks, the reservation and the gate. What each cap bounds is stated
# where open-terminal decides whether a launch is judged. It reads
# open-terminal's globals (CLAIM_ROOT, LANE_ENV, WORKFLOW_STATE, the cap
# settings and options) and calls its ot_message and lane_rejudge, so it is
# loaded by that script alone.
#
# Sourced, never run.

# The locks are held on descriptors 7 (the fleet's) and 8 (the claim store's),
# and a flock stays held while any copy of its descriptor is open. They are
# held only across the count and the reservation write, whose children all
# exit before cap_release, so no child of the launch itself inherits them.

# running status, or a launch not yet recorded), CAP_ACCOUNT (the lanes on
# LANE, canonical: CAP_ACCOUNT_RECORDS, this fleet's held records whose account
# is LANE, plus CAP_ACCOUNT_OTHER, the live claims and reservations on LANE
# that are no held record's own, which are other fleets' lanes and lanes
# nothing recorded), and CAP_ITEM_HELD and CAP_ITEM_ACCOUNT (whether KEY's own
# record is held, and the account it names). For the fleet count a claim of
# this fleet is a held record's own where it names the record's window, so a
# relaunch onto another account is not a second lane of the fleet. For the
# account count it is one where it names the record's window and account and
# this fleet or none, lib/lane-claims.sh's header saying which claims carry
# none. A record's window is `SESSION:WINDOW`, or bare where written by hand,
# and a claim's is the bare name, so the two are compared on the name. The
# records are this fleet's durable count: a GUI launch writes no claim and a
# claim write can fail, and either lane still has its record. They are read
# after the claim store, because a launch writes its record before it drops
# its reservation: a lane whose reservation the claim read missed is a record
# this read finds. Returns 1 on a store it could not read: a count missing a
# lane is a cap that admits one lane too many.
