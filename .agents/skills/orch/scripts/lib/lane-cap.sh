# What a fleet launch is judged on: the overseer binding, the repository the
# launch may run in, and the fleet cap, its count, launch lock, reservation and

# WORKFLOW_STATE, the cap setting and options) and calls its ot_message and
# lane_rejudge, so it is loaded by that script alone.

# The lock is held on descriptor 7, and a flock stays held while any copy of

# of this fleet is a held record's own where it names the record's window, so a

# launch writes no claim and a claim write can fail, and either lane still has
# its record. They are read after the claim store, because a launch writes its
# record before it drops its reservation: a lane whose reservation the claim
# read missed is a record this read finds. Returns 1 on a store it could not

# no checkout names no overseer repository, so the launch binds to its own

# work. A recorded directory git cannot read refuses, and so does a state

# directory's git common root, as its worktrees do, or whose origin names the
