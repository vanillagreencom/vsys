# The fleet cap a fleet launch is judged on: the count, the launch lock, the
# reservation and the gate. What the cap bounds is stated where open-terminal
# decides whether a launch is judged. It reads open-terminal's globals
# (CLAIM_ROOT, WORKFLOW_STATE, the cap setting and options) and calls
# its ot_message and lane_rejudge, so it is loaded by that script alone.
#
# Sourced, never run.

# The lock is held on descriptor 7, and a flock stays held while any copy of

# write, whose children all exit before cap_release, so no child of the launch
# itself inherits it.

# (live claims and reservations naming this fleet that are no held record's
# own: a lane whose pane outlived its record's running status, or a launch not
# yet recorded), and CAP_ITEM_HELD (whether KEY's own record is held). A claim
# of this fleet is a held record's own where it names the record's window, so a
# relaunch onto another account is not a second lane of the fleet, and a parked
# lane's resume, whose reservation names the window its record kept, is counted
# once. A record's window is `SESSION:WINDOW`, or bare
# where written by hand, and a claim's is the bare name, so the two are
# compared on the name. The records are this fleet's durable count: a GUI
# launch writes no claim and a claim write can fail, and either lane still has
# its record. They are read after the claim store, because a launch writes its
# record before it drops its reservation: a lane whose reservation the claim
# read missed is a record this read finds. Returns 1 on a store it could not
# read: a count missing a lane is a cap that admits one lane too many.
