# How oversee-watch reads each lane by what its host kind declares
# (../../schemas/lane-host.md § Host kinds): the host a state record names and
# its capability line, which fleet_merge routes the record by, where each
# lane's files are read and the host a lane-host read of it runs under, the
# judgement of a lane whose kind declares status=none, which no process read
# reaches, and the lane-long age of every running or parked lane. Sourced by oversee-watch, and like the rest of its lib/ it reads
# that script's globals (SCRIPT_DIR, HOSTED, ROOTS, REPOS, WORK_DIR, PW_SEEN,
# PASS_NOW, MARK_REPEAT, LANE_STALL_SECS, CLOUD_STALL_SECS, LANE_AGE_SECS,
# LANE_AGES, RECORDED_ITEMS, FLEET_STATE) and calls its `die`, `ow_message`,
# `close_hosted_lane`, `lane_failure_set` and lane row helpers, and those of
# lib/lane-gitfile.sh and lib/lane-capabilities.sh, which that script sources
# before this file.

# The records host_route sorts by their host kind: the host each hosted record
# names, as `<item>=<host>`, the items whose kind declares no mailbox channel,
# no file access or no status read, and those whose status is a provider verb.
