# job-unit.sh — start a long-lived orch job as a transient systemd user unit
# where a user manager answers, under setsid elsewhere, and stop it by what
# its launch recorded. It bounds a job's lifetime and, when asked, its
# memory, and nothing else: no CPU or task limit. It holds the manager probe, the unit name, the
# systemd-run launch, the setsid fallback, the unit stop and the process-group
# kill for the jobs that use it: dev-validate-run, every job
# references/waiter-launch.md starts (the repeat watch among them), and
# oversee-succeed's watch restart.
# A job with no --cap, one that runs for the session, is a unit only where the
# user manager lingers, since one that does not is stopped, with its units,
# when the user's last login session ends.
# Run it, or source it for the same functions; Bash 3.2.
#
# A unit holds every process the job starts: when the job's main process exits
# or reaches the unit's RuntimeMaxSec, systemd kills every process left in it,
# one that detached into its own session included, SIGTERM first and SIGKILL
# a kill grace later. Under setsid the job leads its own process group and
# calls `end` when it finishes, which tears that group down the same way;
# nothing bounds it, and a job killed before `end`, or a process that
# started its own session, escapes. The unit name shape, the runner lines, the
# unit properties, the stop rule and the orch launches that use their own
# mechanism are references/job-units.md.
#
# Usage:
#   job-unit.sh name NAME PID
#       Print the unit name orch-NAME-PID.
#   job-unit.sh launch NAME RECORD [--cap SECS] [--memory-max MIB] -- ARGV...
#       Start ARGV detached, as the unit orch-NAME-PID where a manager
#       answers (and, with no --cap, lingers), PID being this launch's own
#       process, in this launch's own working directory and environment, and
#       print its runner line. RECORD
#       is written whole before each launch attempt, so the job can read how it
#       runs the moment it starts:
#         runner=systemd|setsid
#         unit=UNIT            where runner=systemd
#         line=RUNNER_LINE
#       --cap is the unit's RuntimeMaxSec, from the timeout the caller already
#       has: set above that bound plus the kill grace, so the job's own bound
#       fires first. A job with no timeout, which runs until it is stopped,
#       passes none, and its unit has no RuntimeMaxSec.
#       --memory-max is the unit's MemoryMax in MiB; no process group holds a
#       memory bound, so a launch that would run under setsid refuses it.
#       A systemd-run that fails after the probe answered falls back to setsid
#       only where the manager has no unit of that name: its call can time out
#       while the manager still starts the unit, which is then the job.
#       Exit 0 launched; 1 RECORD could not be written (record-unwritable); 2
#       no setsid where the fallback needs it (missing-command); 3 usage; 4
#       the job was not started (launch-failed: setsid's exit status, or a
#       unit the manager would not describe); 5 --memory-max where the job
#       would run under setsid (memory-max-unheld, with the runner line).
#   job-unit.sh end RECORD LEADER_PID
#       The job's own last call. Under setsid, tear down the process group
#       LEADER_PID leads, the caller being a member; under a unit, nothing,
#       since the unit's end does the same. Exit 0 done; 2 RECORD could not be
#       read (record-unreadable) or the group could not be killed.
#   job-unit.sh stop UNIT
#       Stop the unit UNIT. Exit 0 it was running and is stopped; 1 the
#       manager has no such unit, so it had ended; 2 anything else, a manager
#       that cannot be reached included.
#   job-unit.sh kill-group PID ARGV_GLOB
#       Tear down the process group PID leads, while PID still runs and its
#       argv matches ARGV_GLOB, so a pid the system reused for anything else is
#       left alone. Exit 0 torn down; 1 left alone; 2 the read or the kill
#       failed.
#
# Every setsid teardown is one: SIGTERM to the group, up to the kill grace for
# its members to exit, then SIGKILL only if any still run. A unit's stop is the
# same SIGTERM and grace.
#   job-unit.sh stop-job RECORD PID ARGV_GLOB
#       Stop the job RECORD describes: its unit by the exact recorded name, or
#       under setsid its group as kill-group does. Exits as those two do, and 2
#       where RECORD could not be read (record-unreadable).
#
# Every failure prints one line, `job-unit: KEY FIELD=VALUE...`, on stderr; a
# unit that had ended and a process left alone are exit 1 and no failure.
# Sourced, each subcommand is the function job_unit_<name with _ for ->, and
# job_unit_read RECORD loads a record into JOB_UNIT_RUNNER, JOB_UNIT_NAME and
# JOB_UNIT_LINE, which launch also sets. A failure leaves its KEY in
# JOB_UNIT_ERROR_KEY and its fields in JOB_UNIT_ERROR.

# The seconds between SIGTERM and SIGKILL, both for what a unit still holds
# when it stops and for a caller's own bound, so the two graces are one number.
