# shellcheck shell=bash
# The security-alert pass of oversee-watch: every open Dependabot, code
# scanning and secret scanning alert in each --repo, reported once until the
# overseer records its verdict in the fleet state's `alerts_triaged`. Sourced
# by oversee-watch, and like the rest of its lib/ it reads that script's
# globals (REPOS, PW_SEEN, WORK_DIR, WORKFLOW_STATE, WORKFLOW_STATE_ARGS) and
# calls its `die`, `ow_message` and lane-row helpers.
#
# The lines it prints are protocol the overseer reads under
# ../../references/security-alerts.md:
#   EVENT security-alert <repo> kind=<kind> number=<N> [severity=<s>]
#         <package|rule>=<name> [manifest=<path>] [scope=<scope>]
#         [advisory=<GHSA>] [validity=<v>] url=<url> [pr=<N>]
#   EVENT security-alerts-unread reads=<source>:<cause>[,<source>:<cause>...]
# <kind> is the alert API's own path segment, `dependabot`, `code-scanning` or
# `secret-scanning`; <path> is the manifest's repository path with each `%`
# and white space character percent-encoded (`%25`, `%20`), so a directory
# name with a space stays one word; a source is `<repo>/<kind>`,
# `<repo>/dependabot-prs` (the alert-to-pull-request link) or
# `alerts_triaged` or `installation-token`; a cause is one of
# security_read_cause's, `invalid` or `credential`.

# ORCH_SECURITY_ALERTS, read once at start: `on` (the default) runs the pass,
# `off` lists nothing, and any other value is refused rather than guessed.
