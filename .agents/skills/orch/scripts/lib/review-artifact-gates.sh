# Content gates for a reviewer's on-disk JSON artifact: the predicates that
# answer "is what this artifact SAYS usable?", as opposed to review-artifact-check's
# own job of locating an artifact, judging its freshness, and dispatching modes.
#
# THREE CHANNELS, NEVER SHARED. Every gate runs through gate_filter, which keeps
# them apart: the gate's ANSWER is stdout, jq's DIAGNOSTIC is a file the parent
# reads, and whether the gate ran at all is the exit status. They were shared
# before and each sharing became a way to read green — an empty answer meaning
# both "clean" and "could not run", then jq's stderr merged into stdout and read
# as a finding (and echoed as a fabricated instrument-failure declaration) by any
# diagnostic that leaves the exit status alone. A gate that cannot answer says so
# on its own channel; nothing it writes can be mistaken for what it found.
#
# artifact_content_gates is the single entry point; the individual gates below
# are its steps and are not called directly by review-artifact-check.
#
