# The review-gate reducer pass of oversee-watch: pr-watch over every --repo,
# each repo's rising edge against its own persisted baseline, and the context
# block every other event carries. Sourced by oversee-watch, and like the rest
# of its lib/ it reads that script's globals (REPOS, PR_WATCH, PW_STATE_DIR,
# WORK_DIR, SINCE) and calls its `die`.

# The latest pr-watch result across every --repo, closing every event block:
# each line carries the repo it came from, and rc is the highest status any
# repo's reducer returned. PW_EVENT marks a pass whose block opened with the
# pr-watch event, where those lines already stand under it.
