# The record a repeat-mode `oversee-watch` keeps of itself, beside the fleet
# state it watches, and the one way to stop it. Two scripts read it:
# `oversee-watch`, which refuses a second watch on one fleet state and takes
# over the one a succession restarted for its pane or one whose pane is gone,
# and `oversee-succeed`, which restarts the running watch from the successor
# pane.
#
# Files, in the directory holding the fleet state:
#   oversee-watch.pid   `key=value` lines: pid (the repeat loop's own pid,
#                       never a launcher's), state (the fleet state path,
#                       resolved), pane (the $TMUX_PANE the watch serves, or
#                       none), origin (hand, or succession for a watch
#                       `oversee-succeed` restarted), script (the watch it
#                       runs) and cwd (the directory it runs in)
#   oversee-watch.argv  NUL-separated: its arguments up to, never including,
#                       the `--` that starts the overseer's own flags, which a
#                       restart replaces with the successor's
#   oversee-watch.log   stdout of a watch a succession restarted, where no
#   oversee-watch.err   harness is reading it, and stderr beside it, where the
#                       restart also writes how it went. The next watch start
#                       on the state other than a succession's prints both
#                       and removes them; the restarted watch, their writer,
#                       never does
#   oversee-watch.runner
#                       lib/job-unit.sh's record of how a succession started
#                       its restart helper, which the restart then overwrites
#                       with how it started the watch; removed with the two
#                       above
#
# A record is live only while its pid runs a process whose command line names
# oversee-watch (watch_pid_runs): a pid read back off disk may by then belong
# to anything.

# Seconds a stopped watch has to give up its record, by removing it or
