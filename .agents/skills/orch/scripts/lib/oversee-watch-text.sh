Blocks until the fleet needs the overseer, then prints every event it found
as one block, each line prefixed with its kind, and exits once. Re-run after
handling every line with the live fleet in scope.

Two passes run on one clock. The mail pass starts every
ORCH_WATCH_MAIL_INTERVAL seconds, reads every lane mailbox, the overseer
mailbox and the lane records one after another, and prints what it finds as
it finds it: lane-question, lane-notice, directive-read, directive-unread,
peer-note, owner-note and owner-ask-resolved. Before the overseer mailbox is
read, every owner ask past its deadline is resolved to its recommendation
through `lane-mail resolve --default`, so the pass reports the ruling it
made. A read that waits on a lock or a slow host delays
the mailboxes after it past that interval, as do the overseer pane below and,
run in this loop, a run's one GitHub auth check before its first long pass
and the heartbeat's open-PR listing. The long pass reads everything else
every --interval seconds, counted start to start and kept across runs in the
state directory, so a run ending on mail news brings the next one no nearer. A long pass runs apart from the mail pass: one that overruns its
interval holds up no mail pass, the next one starts only once it has ended,
and its lines are printed together when it ends. A run with news starts no
further long pass past one already due on the turn the news came, and exits
once none is in flight. A block holding only mail news carries no pr-watch
context. The heartbeat reads the mail once more when a long pass ended after
the last mail pass.

The long pass's events, checked and reported in this order:
  EVENT overseer-dead <pane> window=<window> passes=<N> succession=<on|off>
        source=<record|rows|process|pane> [record=<server>:<pane>|none]
                             the OVERSEER's own session — the $TMUX_PANE this
                             watch was started from — read `exited` on N
                             consecutive passes. `source` names what settled
                             it: `record`, the exit status `overseer-run`
                             wrote into the fleet state's overseer.exit once
                             the launch line returned, over a bare shell with
                             nothing under it; `rows`, a SessionEnd row its
                             harness wrote to the file the fleet state's
                             overseer.session_rows names, over that same bare
                             shell; `process`, a pane whose process is a bare
                             shell with nothing under it; `pane`, the named
                             fallback where no row can judge, the pane
                             captured and read by the shared judge, with an
                             overseer-fallback notice naming the cause.
                             record= is carried where no successor is launched
                             for want of a line: the fleet state's overseer
                             record by its server and pane, or none. Nothing
                             else notices an overseer that ended: its lanes
                             keep working, this watch keeps printing to a log
                             nobody reads, and the fleet runs unattended. The
                             line also goes to the fleet log and to the
                             overseer mailbox, where the successor reads it as
                             an owner-note. Unless ORCH_OVERSEER_SUCCESSION is
                             `off`, the watch then launches that successor
                             into the dead pane's window slot through
                             `oversee-succeed --dead-pane`, with the launch
                             line the fleet state recorded (a succession's
                             pending successor line ahead of the session's
                             own), and stops: the successor runs a watch of
                             its own
  EVENT overseer-walled <pane> window=<window> passes=<N> succession=<on|off>
        source=<rows|account|pane>
                             the same session read `walled`: from `rows`, a
                             StopFailure row whose error is `rate_limit`,
                             standing unless its account measures room, its
                             message, or message=unrecorded, under the line; from `account`, a live
                             session whose own account the mark judgement
                             reads at zero headroom, its account and reset
                             under the line; both on the first pass that
                             reads them. Or, from the `pane` fallback, on N
                             consecutive passes read by the same judge AND
                             its own account judged
                             at or below its trigger: the harness is still
                             running and its ACCOUNT is spent. Such a session
                             takes no turn, so it answers no lane, reads no
                             mail and cannot hand itself over — a fleet as
                             unattended as a death leaves, reached by the
                             other road. The account judgement is
                             `oversee-succeed --check-marks`, the same one
                             overseer-mark rests on, and it is required
                             because THIS pane carries the limit banners this
                             watch relays about other lanes: a wall the
                             account refutes is one of those, and the pane is
                             left alone under overseer-wall-unconfirmed. The
                             banner's own window follows a pane wall's line,
                             as it does for a lane's usage-limit. The line
                             goes to the
                             same two channels. The successor is launched
                             through `oversee-succeed --walled-pane`, which
                             picks its account afresh and never reopens on the
                             spent one; the line it built is on the watch's
                             stderr under the event. Where no account
                             qualifies, one `overseer-recovery-blocked` notice
                             naming the account and when its binding bucket
                             frees up goes to both channels and the repeat
                             stops
  EVENT overseer-mark <pane> kind=<headroom|rate|qualifying> value=<N> mark=<N>
                             succession=<on|off>
                             the OVERSEER's own account reached its mark,
                             judged by `oversee-succeed --check-marks`; its
                             context mark is its turn-end hook's alone. It
                             reaches an overseer BETWEEN turn ends, where that
                             hook cannot: the hook refuses at the same marks,
                             and a session part way
                             through a long turn meets neither until this line.
                             The route follows on the next line. Emitted once
                             at the crossing and again every
                             ORCH_OVERSEER_MARK_REPEAT passes while it stands;
                             a reading that could not be taken leaves the
                             standing mark where it was and says so on stderr
  EVENT overseer-context-unmeasured <pane> gap=<reason>
                             this overseer's context record, context.json in
                             the overseer mailbox, carries no reading: its
                             lane-mail-check turn-end hook read nothing and
                             wrote why as the gap, a word that hook's
                             description lists. Its context mark is judged at
                             that turn end alone, so it is not being judged.
                             The route per gap is references/oversee-events.md
                             § Event kinds. Emitted every long pass it stands.
                             A record another session wrote, naming another
                             pane, a harness other than the fleet record's or
                             a session other than the pane's latest start,
                             prints neither context event
  EVENT overseer-context-stale <pane> age=<seconds>
                             this overseer's context record is more than an
                             hour old and a turn end its hook dated with a
                             Stop row came after it, so its turn ends record
                             nothing and its context mark is judged by
                             nothing; a session with no Stop row after the
                             record gets no such judgement. Emitted every long
                             pass it stands
  EVENT pr-watch rc=N        new review-gate attention; reducer output follows
  EVENT merged <PR> <branch> <repo>
                             an --item PR merged at or after --since, in any
                             --repo. A parked record's item is an --item for
                             this check alone, and the merge of the pull
                             request its record names, in that repository,
                             runs the close below at once: nothing wakes a
                             parked sandbox. Another pull request on the
                             branch's name is reported and closes nothing,
                             under a parked-merge-unmatched note on stderr
                             naming the recorded key and the keys seen; the
                             repository is matched in lower case, GitHub's
                             names being case-insensitive
  EVENT triage <item>        an item created at or after --since that is absent
                             from the first repository's persisted baseline
  EVENT lane-ready <item>    a lane open-terminal handed to a background job
                             while its host prepared it is launched: its
                             record reads running, and the watch carries it
  EVENT lane-prepare-failed <item> reason=<reason> log=<path>
                             that job failed and closed its window: reason
                             wait-failed is the host's preparation,
                             launch-failed a launch step, each named in the
                             job's log. The record reads stopped, which
                             lane-close closes
  EVENT lane-prepare-stuck <item> age=<secs>s log=<path>
                             that record has read preparing for longer than
                             ORCH_WATCH_PREPARE_SECS with no outcome written;
                             lane-close closes it.
                             These three are read from --state records and
                             reported once per preparation
  EVENT start-stalled <item> age=<secs>
                             a running --state record names a mail_root whose
                             tmp/lane-status-<item>.md does not exist
                             ORCH_WATCH_START_STALL_SECS after the record went
                             running, its running_at (launched_at on a record
                             with none), on every harness, a hosted one read
                             through `lane-host cat`: the lane never started
                             its workflow. age= counts from that stamp, which
                             a relaunch renews, so the line after a relaunch
                             is a second stall. Reported once and again every
                             ORCH_OVERSEER_MARK_REPEAT passes while it stands;
                             a record whose file once stood is never reported
  EVENT window-gone <lane>   the tmux window no longer exists. Nothing follows
                             the line: the remedy is one relaunch, which
                             reads the item's worktree and PR, not a screen
  EVENT lane-exited <lane>   `pgrep -P` reports no child under a bare shell on
                             two passes; the lane's closing lines follow. An
                             unusable probe is not an answer and keeps the
                             lane watched
  EVENT lane-closed <item>   under a lane-exited whose window watches a --hosted
                             item already reported merged, once the pass finds
                             its worktree gone, or under the merged event of a
                             parked record, whose sandbox is stopped and whose
                             close needs no pane: `lane-close` succeeded;
                             the provider's output follows, then `kept=none`
                             when that output has no `kept=` line because the
                             close archived nothing. A lane exiting while its
                             worktree stands is not closed. A parked close
                             that fails is lane-close-failed on stderr and
                             drops the parked pull request's key alone from
                             its merged row, committed at once, so the next
                             pass reports that merge again and retries the
                             close, while the pass's other merges stay
                             delivered and this pass runs on to its remaining
                             checks and exits 2 at its end; lane-close-refused
                             commits it and is never retried
  EVENT lane-close-refused <item>
                             the same close exited 3: its clone or worktree
                             has user-owned changes. Generated whole-file render
                             drift is archived and cleaned instead of refused.
                             `path=PATH` follows, taken from the
                             provider's `close-refused path=PATH` line, or
                             `path=unknown` without one; the sandbox stays.
                             Never retried, never --force
  EVENT handoff <item>       the --item's workflow state carries a `.handoff`
                             record with no `.resumed_at`; the record follows.
                             Emitted once per record, on every surface: it
                             reads the item's state, never a pane.
  EVENT usage-limit <lane> [<config-dir>] [resets=<utc>]
                             a live harness with no turn in flight shows a
                             limit banner below the last user turn on its screen.
                             The block that follows is a window AROUND that
                             banner, a few lines above it and the rest of the
                             cap below, so the banner is always in the block
                             and the sentence marking a quoted wall travels
                             with it.
                             `resets=` carries the reset time the banner
                             states; the wall is still standing. It is absent

The mail pass's events, in this order, lane by lane and the overseer's own
mailbox last:
  EVENT lane-question <item> <id>
                             the --item's lane appended an ask to its lane
                             mailbox; its text follows. Answer it with
                             `lane-mail send --re <id>`. Read from the
                             mailbox, never a pane, so it runs on every
                             surface, inside tmux or not
  EVENT lane-notice <item> <id>
                             the same, for a notice the lane wants read but
                             is not waiting on; its text follows
  EVENT directive-read <item> <id>
                             the lane's to-lane.cursor has passed a directive
                             sent to it: the lane has read it. The cursor is
                             the receipt, whichever of the lane's read paths
                             moved it. A lane first watched is taken as
                             having read up to its cursor, reported for
                             nothing already read; a cursor lane-mail
                             reports `missed` seeds nothing
  EVENT directive-unread <item> <id> age=<seconds>
                             a directive the cursor has not passed is older
                             than ORCH_DIRECTIVE_UNREAD_SECS; reported on
                             the first mail pass past that age, and again
                             as directive-read once the lane reads it
  EVENT peer-note <repo> <id> kind=<kind> [re=<ask id>]
                             a note, ask or answer another repository's
                             overseer sent to this one with `lane-mail peer`.
                             kind is ask, answer or directive, and only an ask
                             is owed a reply; `re=` names the ask of this
                             overseer's that an answer replies to
  EVENT owner-note <id>      a note in the overseer's own mailbox, sent with
                             `lane-mail send --item overseer --directive`;
                             its text follows. Read with or without --item.
  EVENT owner-ask-resolved <ask id> by=<text|default>
                             an owner ask of this overseer's is closed: by
                             the owner's own words, which `lane-mail resolve
                             --text` wrote, or by its recommendation, which
                             this watch wrote at the deadline; the ruling's
                             text follows. Reported once per ask, since an
                             ask resolves once.
                             Every text and `options:` line of these kinds
                             is indented two spaces, so a message line never
                             begins with EVENT
The overseer mailbox is read through its own to-lane.cursor, which a session
start's `lane-mail inbox --item overseer` moves too, acknowledged only once
its notes are printed, whatever state directory, --since or checkout this
watch runs with. A session start's read between the peek and the
acknowledgement reports a note twice. The lane-mail hooks move it too, for
a lead session in the checkout while no repeat watch holds the fleet state:
with single passes, every lead session there, the overseer included. A line
they take is not reported here.
Before every mail pass the overseer's session is read once, as the long pass
reads it; while it reads exited, or walled, no mailbox is read, so a
successor finds what was sent in the meantime. A rows wall stands unless its
own account measures room; a screen wall stands only where its own account
confirms it, and one no judgement could settle reads live. A wall that reads
live has its mail read, and the long pass starts no successor for it. Off tmux there is no
such pane and the mail is read; a pane that cannot be read reads live too,
except while a long pass is in flight, which may be closing it in a
succession, and the mail waits for that pass to end.

Every pane payload above is the lines that event's handling reads and no
more, always taken from below the lane's last user turn and capped by
ORCH_WATCH_TAIL_LINES. A dialog and a closing report are drawn at the bottom
of a pane, so those keep the LAST lines of the slice and a longer slice
loses its top ones; nothing in the event recovers them, and only a larger
ORCH_WATCH_TAIL_LINES carries more. A usage-limit block is the exception: it
is a window around the banner rather than either end of the slice, so the one
line its handling needs is never the line the cap drops, and it arrives with
the lines on BOTH sides that say whose words they are.

Only lane-exited drops the prompt noise a removed worktree repeats
(`^Hook failed:` and `^bash: cd: ...: No such file or directory`), which
would otherwise be the whole payload of a lane that deleted its own tree; the
shell drawing those has the terminal back only once the harness is gone, so
no other kind can carry them. A slice that is nothing but that noise prints
`payload-noise-only lines=N` in place of the block, so silence and
suppression read apart. No other payload is filtered.

The latest pr-watch attention lines close the block when any exist and the
pr-watch event did not open it. Triage
reads the live tracker list and rebuilds only acknowledged triage keys in the
first repository's OVERSEE_WATCH_STATE_DIR baseline from kept or canceled
verdicts. Lane prompts use pane and turn.

A line already delivered is not delivered again by a re-run: overseer-dead,
overseer-walled, merged, lane-asking, usage-limit, model-capacity,
lane-exited, idle-after-return, handoff and account are keyed in that
baseline. Mail is reported at least once and never lost: lane-question,
lane-notice, directive-unread and, for a directive read after its lane is
first watched, directive-read are keyed in the mail pass's own file beside
it, owner-note, owner-ask-resolved and peer-note by the overseer mailbox's
cursor, each committed only once printed, so a stop between the two reports a line
twice: a repeated id is one already seen. A lane whose to-lane read
lane-mail reports `missed` has nothing reported or moved that pass; a cursor
below the one reported holds only its directive lines. Each repeats only when what it reports changes: another PR, a
different wall or a reset gone by, a replacement pane, a different screen, a
new record, another account state. An unchanged standing overseer-mark is the one keyed line that
comes back on a timer: it is reported every ORCH_OVERSEER_MARK_REPEAT passes
while it stands, so a repeat there is the interval and never a new crossing.
A suppressed line still holds: a walled lane
stays walled, an overseer past its mark is still past it, and the
pass runs on to the remaining checks and the heartbeat. A lane mailbox read
that comes back shorter than the lines already drained from it, an empty one
included, is a read that missed lines rather than a replacement, and moves no
position: only a mailbox opening with another envelope, or one whose first
line carries no id and that holds fewer lines, is read whole again.

Options:
  --interval SECS     seconds from the start of one long pass to the start of
                      the next (default 240)
  --max-loops N       long passes before a heartbeat (default 25)
  --since ISO8601     UTC created/merged-at floor, with a Z suffix. Pass the
                      fleet's fixed start time on every run, never "now" — the
                      value names the state file, so a run given a different
                      one starts from no sightings and parks every walled lane
                      afresh; LINEAR_TEAM below arms the triage check
  --item ISSUE_ID     live item; repeatable. No values skips merged and
                      handoff with a note
  --repo OWNER/REPO   repository; repeatable and case-normalized. Every
                      check reads all of them; triage and lane rows persist
                      in the first one's baseline, mail rows in the file
                      beside it
  --hosted ITEM=REMOTE_ROOT
                      the item's lane lives on another host; its mailbox is
                      read through `lane-host` against REMOTE_ROOT rather
                      than this disk. Repeatable, once per item. An item with
                      no --hosted entry is read from `worktree path ITEM`,
                      and the project root when that reports none. The
                      clone root is learned from REMOTE_ROOT/.git and kept:
                      the item's workflow state is read from the clone, and
                      so is its mailbox once the worktree is gone. A window
                      watches the item it is named for, and gh-N watches
                      issue-N, as open-terminal names a GitHub item's lane.
                      A run carrying any hosted lane, from this option or a
                      state record with a host, while `lane-host resolve`
                      answers local is refused as hosted-without-host rather
                      than read on this disk
  --root ITEM=PATH    the item's lane worktree on this disk, where its
                      mailbox is read; a lane whose worktree sits outside
                      this checkout is read nowhere else. Repeatable, once per
                      item; a --hosted entry for the same item wins
  --handoff PATH      the overseer handoff file a successor's brief names,
                      passed through to `oversee-succeed` when this watch
                      records the overseer's launch line (default
                      tmp/handoffs/OVERSEER-HANDOFF.md)
  LANE_WINDOW...      tmux window names to watch; requires $TMUX or
                      ORCH_TMUX_SESSION, which lets a watch outside tmux
                      reach the fleet's session. A bare name is a window in
                      that session, else the session this watch started in,
                      which it resolves once through $TMUX_PANE and names on
                      stderr as session-resolved, so a pane that later dies
                      moves no lane into another session; `session:window`,
                      tmux's own target form, names one in another session.
                      A bare name with no session resolved is refused as
                      session-unresolved naming the lane and the --state
                      file; a setting tmux does not hold as session-missing,
                      and a has-session call failing for any other reason,
                      no server at the socket among them, as tmux-failed
                      naming that socket
  --harness H         the OVERSEER's harness, claude, codex, copilot or pi,
                      handed to each oversee-succeed call; a Codex or Copilot
                      CLI pane reads node and a pi pane pi, which the pane
                      reader maps to no one harness
  -- OVERSEER_FLAGS...
                      the flags the OVERSEER itself runs under — its
                      permission flags, plus its current model and effort
                      flags, regardless of ORCH_OVERSEER_PREFERENCE. These are
                      the same words `oversee-succeed -- ...` takes. This
                      watch replaces the fleet state's overseer.launch_line
                      once at startup, because a
                      dead pane can no longer be asked what it was launched
                      with. A watch started without them records a line with
                      no permission flags, and the successor it relaunches
                      stops at the first prompt nobody is there to answer.
                      A record naming this pane answers the line's harness
                      and account, and its model and effort as a pair where
                      it names a model (`oversee-succeed --help`).
                      A line this start cannot build or record is the
                      notice overseer-line-missing or overseer-unrecorded,
                      on stderr and in the fleet log, and the watch runs
                      on: the session is judged from the exit status and
                      rows file the record already holds for this pane, and
                      from the pane, the named fallback, where it names
                      none; a death relaunches from the line the fleet
                      state already holds where its record names this pane
                      by server and pane id, the last line a launch, a
                      succession or a watch start recorded for it, which a
                      session restarted by hand may not have been started
                      with; a record naming another pane, or none, reports
                      the death with no successor, naming that record
  --repeat SECS       the watch for a session: run one watch per pass with
                      the other options, sleep SECS after it exits, or
                      ORCH_WATCH_MAIL_INTERVAL where that is shorter and the
                      pass did not exit 2, and run the next. A successor launch, a
                      notice-only recovery or an exhausted retry stops the
                      repeat command with status 0. Requires --state. A
                      window that tmux does not list is carried until a pass
                      exits 0 having reported window-gone with one stderr
                      note; later passes name it --skip-lane until tmux lists
                      it again.
                      The repeat loop records itself beside the --state
                      file: its own pid, whatever launched it, the state
                      path, the pane it serves, its origin, its script and
                      directory in oversee-watch.pid, and its arguments
                      before -- in oversee-watch.argv. That record is the
                      watch's claim, which the start refusals below and a
                      succession's handover read; how an overseer launches,
                      finds and stops its watch is
                      references/watch-delivery.md's. However it is sent,
                      TERM on the loop removes the record at once, ends
                      the pass it is running and exits once that pass has;
                      a lane-close part way through is run to its end and
                      reported first, and a start that took that watch over
                      waits for it under a watch-finishing note. A start on a
                      state whose recorded watch still runs is refused as
                      watch-running naming that pid, except where that watch
                      is the one `oversee-succeed` restarted for this same
                      pane after a self-succession, or serves a pane tmux no
                      longer lists: that watch is stopped and replaced, under
                      a watch-taken-over note. Every start but a succession's
                      then prints, under a watch-replayed note, and removes
                      oversee-watch.log and oversee-watch.err beside the
                      state: what a restarted watch printed where no session
                      read it, and what the restart itself said; it removes
                      the restart's oversee-watch.runner with them. A watch
                      a succession started writes those two files, so it
                      never prints or removes them
  --state PATH        the oversee workflow-state file open-terminal records
                      every lane in (`workflow-state path oversee`), re-read
                      before every loop of the run and, in repeat mode,
                      before every pass as well. Repeat mode's automatic
                      close uses the directory containing this file. Each
                      `lanes[]` entry whose status is `running` is one
                      --item, its `window` one LANE_WINDOW when set, and its
                      `mail_root` one --hosted entry when `host` is set and
                      one --root entry otherwise, all added to any given on
                      the command line, the state's entry winning where both
                      name one item or window, so a lane launched, relaunched
                      or closed while the run loops joins or leaves it with
                      no restart. A `lanes[]` entry whose status is `parked`,
                      its sandbox stopped by `lane-close --park` with its disk
                      kept, is one --item for the merged check alone: its
                      pane is gone and its mailbox and state are on a stopped
                      disk, so no other check reads it, and the merge of the
                      pull request its `parked` names, in that repository,
                      runs the hosted close in the same pass.
                      The set is noted on stderr as fleet-read whenever a
                      read changes what the reader last carried, with the
                      count of records whose status is not running, so a
                      state that parses to no running lane is named rather
                      than watched in silence, and with the parked records
                      it carries for the merged check: a standalone run names the
                      fleet its own first read found, repeat mode names the
                      fleet it launches each pass with, and a pass names a
                      change one of its own loops found
  --skip-lane WINDOW  a lane window this run does not watch, whatever the
                      state says; its item stays watched. Repeat mode names
                      each window a pass already reported gone, so the record
                      that still carries it is not reported again every loop,
                      and hands every pass the windows given here besides.

Exit codes:
  0  at least one EVENT line was printed
  3  overseer-dead or overseer-walled was reported and a successor took that
     overseer's
     window. This watch is done: the successor runs its own. Repeat mode
     stops on it and exits 0
  2  usage or global failure, or a lane-local mailbox, clone or
     workflow-state read failed. A lane-local
     failure is reported and the pass reads the remaining lanes before it
     exits. An unchanged lane-local failure, a provider-reported stopped state
     among them, stays quiet after its first report until a successful read or
     a different failure, and fails no run after that first one. A
     state write can fail after its event was printed. Pr-watch commits
     repository baselines in order, so earlier repository baselines may
     already have advanced when a later rename fails. Only baselines that did
     not advance repeat their events
Repeat mode prints each pass's output and ignores its exit code. It exits 2
only on a usage error, a state file it cannot read or parse, an argument a
pass would refuse (an item, a --hosted entry, a repeated --repo, a lane
outside tmux or outside any resolved session, a hosted lane with no host), a
tmux window list that fails, a watch already running on its state, a record
it cannot write, or a repeat delay it cannot sleep. TERM ends it at 143,
stopping the pass it was running and that pass's long pass; TERM is the stop
signal on every start. A watch started as a background job ignores INT from
its start, which no trap can take back; the orch job runner adds no ignore.

Which mode fits the overseer's harness:
  repeat       a harness that delivers a detached log's lines as they are
               written or holds a blocking follow of it inside the turn.
               The watch runs detached and outlives the session, so it
               reports overseer-dead
  single pass  a harness whose only wake is a background command's exit:
               each pass runs as that command and the next starts after
               every line is handled. Nothing reports overseer-dead
references/watch-delivery.md holds each harness's mechanism and re-arm rule.

When pr-watch.sh is installed, oversee-watch runs it with --heal on every pass.
Gate-stale dispatches PR_WATCH_WRITER_WORKFLOW, so its credential requires
actions:write. When pr-watch.sh is absent, the step is skipped with one stderr note.
Inside tmux, an --item with no LANE_WINDOW skips the pane checks with one
stderr note; outside tmux there is no pane to read and nothing is noted.

Environment:
  LINEAR_TEAM                 team the triage check reads under --since and
                              the heartbeat's owed items read with --state,
                              from kendex.settings.toml [env] unless the
                              environment sets it. Empty or absent skips
                              triage, said once, and reads the owed items from
                              open PRs; with a team a missing tracker CLI or
                              workflow-state exits 2 rather than dropping it
  ORCH_STATE_DIR              workflow-state directory; relative paths join
                              the project root; absolute paths stay unchanged
  ORCH_WATCH_TAIL_LINES       most lines any one event's pane payload prints,
                              a positive whole number, default 12. At the

                              dialog arrive whole; the Codex model picker's
                              slice is 19 lines, so it keeps its bottom 12 and
                              loses the startup box above them

                              than dropping the mail pass
  OVERSEE_WATCH_LANES         path to lanes, whose `list --json` is the
                              account reading behind the account event and the
                              heartbeat roster; a missing one exits 2. The read
                              takes the same 60 second ceiling and usage age as
                              the overseer's own mark judgement
  OVERSEE_WATCH_REPORT        path to oversee-report, whose `due` judges the

                              walled overseer. A missing one leaves the
                              overseer check to report and launch nothing,
                              said once
  ORCH_OVERSEER_DEAD_PASSES   consecutive passes the overseer must read
                              `exited` before overseer-dead goes out, and
                              its pane `walled` before a screen wall's
                              overseer-walled does (default 2). One pass is a
                              poll that caught a live session between its
                              harness and its shell. A screen wall also needs
                              its account judged at or below

                              room, and an account read at zero headroom go
                              out on the first pass
  ORCH_OVERSEER_SUCCESSION    `off` leaves the overseer-dead and
                              overseer-walled notices and
                              launches no successor; `oversee-succeed` owns
                              every other value. An overseer-mark line still
                              goes out under it, carrying succession=off
  ORCH_OVERSEER_MARK_REPEAT   passes a standing overseer-mark waits before it
                              is reported again (default 5). The first crossing
                              is always reported; this only bounds how often a
                              mark the overseer has not yet acted on comes back.
                              The judgement itself runs every pass and reads
                              every account the fleet can launch on, under a 60
                              second ceiling where `timeout` is installed; a
                              read that passes it leaves the mark unjudged for
                              that pass, and on a host without `timeout` the
