Blocks until the fleet needs the overseer, then prints every event it found
as one block, each line prefixed with its kind, and exits once. Re-run after
handling every line with the live fleet in scope.

Two passes run on one clock. The mail pass starts every
ORCH_WATCH_MAIL_INTERVAL seconds, reads every lane mailbox, the overseer
mailbox and the lane records one after another, and prints what it finds as
it finds it: lane-question, lane-notice, directive-read, directive-unread,
peer-note, owner-note, owner-ask-resolved and owner-ask-closed. Hosted mail
uses `lane-host read-many` once per provider per mail pass, as
schemas/lane-host.md specifies. Before the overseer mailbox is read,
`lane-mail resolve --default` closes due owner asks.
Only an unanswered ask receives a recommendation answer. The interval is
counted start to start and kept across runs in the state directory. Between
two mail passes, and through a --repeat sleep, the overseer mailbox's size is
checked once a second, and once it moves that mailbox alone is read, so a
note to the overseer is printed within about a second while the lane
mailboxes keep the interval; a run's first turn reads it alone too when no
mail pass is due. A run's first long pass follows a read of every mailbox in
that run, due or not. ORCH_WATCH_MAIL_INTERVAL 0 checks nothing between turns. A read that waits
on a lock or a slow host delays
the mailboxes after it past that interval, as do the overseer pane below and,
run in this loop, a run's one GitHub auth check before its first long pass
and the heartbeat's open-PR listing. The long pass reads everything else
every --interval seconds, counted start to start and kept across runs in the
state directory, so a run ending on mail news brings the next one no nearer. A long pass runs apart from the mail pass: one that overruns its
interval holds up no mail pass, the next one starts only once it has ended,
and its lines are printed together when it ends. A run with news starts no
further long pass past one already due on the turn the news came, and exits
once none is in flight. A block holding only mail news carries no pr-watch
context. The heartbeat reads the mail once more when a long pass ended after
the last mail pass.

The long pass's events, checked and reported in this order:
  EVENT overseer-dead <pane> window=<window> passes=<N> succession=<on|off>
        source=<record|rows|process|context|pane> [record=<server>:<pane>|none]
                             the OVERSEER's own session — the $TMUX_PANE this
                             watch was started from — read `exited` on N
                             consecutive passes. `source` names what settled
                             it: `context`, a harness still up whose context
                             fills its window, so it takes no turn again: a
                             StopFailure row naming a prompt-too-long error,
                             or its context record a reading at or past the
                             window it names with no Stop row after it, for
                             a claude, codex or pi reading only: a copilot
                             reading's window is where Copilot compacts;
                             `record`, the exit status `overseer-run`
                             wrote into the fleet state's overseer.exit once
                             the launch line returned, over a bare shell with
                             nothing but shells under it; `rows`, a SessionEnd
                             row its harness wrote to the file the fleet
                             state's overseer.session_rows names, over that
                             same bare shell; `process`, a pane whose process
                             is a bare shell with nothing but shells under it;
                             `pane`, the named fallback where no row can
                             judge, the pane captured and read by the shared
                             judge, with an overseer-fallback notice naming
                             the cause.
                             record= is carried where no successor is launched
                             for want of a line: the fleet state's overseer
                             record by its server and pane, or none. Nothing
                             else notices an overseer that ended: its lanes
                             keep working, this watch keeps printing to a log
                             nobody reads, and the fleet runs unattended. The
                             line also goes to the fleet log and to the
                             overseer mailbox, where the successor reads it as
                             an owner-note. Unless ORCH_OVERSEER_SUCCESSION is
                             `off`, the watch then launches that successor
                             into the dead pane's window slot through
                             `oversee-succeed --dead-pane`, with the launch
                             line the fleet state recorded (a succession's
                             pending successor line ahead of the session's
                             own), and stops: the successor runs a watch of
                             its own
  EVENT overseer-walled <pane> window=<window> passes=<N> succession=<on|off>
        source=<auth|rows|account|pane>
                             the session read `walled`:
                             from `auth`, a login failure in the current
                             pane turn. From `rows`, Claude Code's
                             authentication_failed StopFailure is also a
                             login wall. Both recover on the first pass,
                             even with usage room or a previous successful
                             row. No account mark confirmation is required.
                             For usage limits, from `rows`, a
                             StopFailure row whose error is `rate_limit`,
                             standing unless its account measures room, its
                             message, or message=unrecorded, under the line; from `account`, a live
                             session whose own account judgement reads
                             mark-reached kind=headroom value=0, account
                             and reset under the line; both on the first pass that
                             reads them. Or, from the `pane` fallback, on N
                             consecutive passes read by the same judge AND
                             that judgement reading mark-reached
                             kind=headroom: the harness is still running
                             and its ACCOUNT is spent. Such a session
                             takes no turn, so it answers no lane, reads no
                             mail and cannot hand itself over — a fleet as
                             unattended as a death leaves, reached by the
                             other road. The account judgement is
                             `oversee-succeed --check-marks`, the same one
                             overseer-mark rests on, and it is required
                             because THIS pane carries the limit banners this
                             watch relays about other lanes: a wall the
                             account refutes is one of those, and the pane is
                             left alone under overseer-wall-unconfirmed. The
                             banner's own window follows a pane wall's line,
                             as it does for a lane's usage-limit. The line
                             goes to the
                             same two channels. The successor is launched
                             through `oversee-succeed --walled-pane`, which
                             picks its account afresh and never reopens on the
                             walled one; the line it built is on the watch's
                             stderr under the event. Where no account
                             qualifies, one `overseer-recovery-blocked` notice
                             goes to both channels and the repeat stops.
                             Measured account and reset values need an
                             account mark. Unmeasured fields read
                             account=unknown and resets=none. Login recovery
                             has no usage reset: sign in to an account, then
                             start a fresh overseer by hand
  EVENT overseer-mark <pane> kind=<headroom|rate|qualifying> value=<N> mark=<N>
                             succession=<on|off>
                             the OVERSEER's own account reached its mark,
                             judged by `oversee-succeed --check-marks`; who
                             judges its context mark is
                             references/oversee-events.md § Judgement rules,
                             the overseer's own case. It reaches an overseer
                             BETWEEN turn ends, where its lane-mail-check
                             hook judges no account mark: the hook refuses at
                             the same marks at a turn end, and a session part
                             way through a long turn meets neither until this
                             line.
                             The route follows on the next line. Emitted once
                             at the crossing and again every
                             ORCH_OVERSEER_MARK_REPEAT passes while it stands;
                             a reading that could not be taken leaves the
                             standing mark where it was and says so on stderr
  EVENT overseer-context-unmeasured <pane> gap=<reason>
                             this overseer's context record, context.json in
                             the overseer mailbox, carries no reading: its
                             lane-mail-check hook read nothing and
                             wrote why as the gap, a word that hook's
                             description lists. With no reading its context
                             mark is not judged (references/oversee-events.md
                             § Judgement rules). The route per gap is
                             references/overseer-session-events.md.
                             Emitted on the first long pass it stands; still
                             standing on the next, it goes to the owner
                             instead, as one `lane-mail notice --to owner`
                             and one fleet-log row, with an
                             overseer-context-alerted line on stderr; a
                             notice that fails is tried again the next pass,
                             and once it is sent neither is repeated while
                             that gap stands.

                             pane, a harness other than the fleet record's or
                             a session other than the pane's latest start,

                             nothing and its context mark is judged by
                             nothing; a session with no Stop row after the
                             record gets no such judgement. Emitted every long

                             the log could not be read or held no ranked line.
                             Reported once, again when the

                             A new pair is reported only when its newer run is
                             the newest run the watch has read and not yet
                             judged. A pair that would open an incident, or
                             any pair with no run recorded, is reported only
                             when its newer run is also the newest completed
                             run in the unfiltered run list. A later attempt
                             of a re-run is newer. A page older than the

                             judges nothing.
                             A repository without that workflow is skipped.
                             A failed read prints refresh-unread on stderr,
                             leaves the failure pair intact when the run list

                             Reported in the long pass that reads it, once
                             per changed jobs or set of failing suites. Suite timing
                             and passing-test counts do not change that key.
                             A later run with the same failures stays quiet.
                             A completed run with no failure or a proven
                             absent workflow clears the incident. A failed run or
                             jobs read prints main-push-unread on stderr and
                             keeps the incident intact. A failed log read
                             prints that notice and keeps known failures when

                             a Codex turn ended because its selected model is

The mail pass's events, in this order, lane by lane and the overseer's own
mailbox last:
  EVENT lane-question <item> <id>
                             the --item's lane appended an ask to its lane
                             mailbox; its text follows. Answer it with
                             `lane-mail send --re <id>`. Read from the
                             mailbox, never a pane, so it runs on every
                             surface, inside tmux or not
  EVENT lane-notice <item> <id>
                             the same, for a notice the lane wants read but
                             is not waiting on; its text follows
  EVENT directive-read <item> <id>
                             the lane's to-lane.cursor has passed a directive
                             sent to it: the lane has read it. The cursor is
                             the receipt, whichever of the lane's read paths
                             moved it. A lane first watched is taken as
                             having read up to its cursor, reported for
                             nothing already read; a cursor lane-mail
                             reports `missed` seeds nothing
  EVENT directive-unread <item> <id> age=<seconds>
                             a directive the cursor has not passed is older
                             than ORCH_DIRECTIVE_UNREAD_SECS; reported on
                             the first mail pass past that age, and again
                             as directive-read once the lane reads it
  EVENT peer-note <repo> <id> kind=<kind> [re=<ask id>]
                             a note, ask or answer another repository's
                             overseer sent to this one with `lane-mail peer`.
                             kind is ask, answer or directive, and only an ask
                             is owed a reply; `re=` names the ask of this
                             overseer's that an answer replies to
  EVENT owner-note <id>      a note in the overseer's own mailbox, sent with
                             `lane-mail send --item overseer --directive`;
                             its text follows. Read with or without --item.
  EVENT owner-ask-resolved <ask id> by=<text|default> id=<answer id>
                             an answer to an owner ask; its text follows.
                             Each answer has its own id and leaves the ask
                             open until resolve closes it. A default answer
                             supplies the recommendation only if unanswered.
  EVENT owner-ask-closed <ask id> by=<explicit|text|default>
                             the separate close record. The owner's words
                             stand when an answered ask reaches its deadline.
                             Every text and `options:` line of these kinds
                             is indented two spaces, so a message line never
                             begins with EVENT
The overseer mailbox is read through its own to-lane.cursor, which a session
start's `lane-mail inbox --item overseer` moves too, acknowledged only once
its notes are printed, whatever state directory, --since or checkout this
watch runs with. A session start's read between the peek and the
acknowledgement reports a note twice. The lane-mail hooks move it too, for
the session the fleet record names while no repeat watch holds the fleet
state: with single passes, the overseer itself. A line they take is not
reported here.
Before every mail pass the overseer's session is read once, as the long pass
reads it; while it reads exited, or walled, no mailbox is read, so a
successor finds what was sent in the meantime. A rows wall stands unless its
own account measures room; a screen wall stands only where its own account
confirms it, and one no judgement could settle reads live. A wall that reads
live has its mail read, and the long pass starts no successor for it. Off tmux there is no
such pane and the mail is read; a pane that cannot be read reads live too,
except while a long pass is in flight, which may be closing it in a
succession, and the mail waits for that pass to end.

Every pane payload above is the lines that event's handling reads and no
more, always taken from below the lane's last user turn and capped by
ORCH_WATCH_TAIL_LINES. A dialog and a closing report are drawn at the bottom
of a pane, so those keep the LAST lines of the slice and a longer slice
loses its top ones; nothing in the event recovers them, and only a larger
ORCH_WATCH_TAIL_LINES carries more. A usage-limit block is the exception: it
is a window around the banner rather than either end of the slice, so the one
line its handling needs is never the line the cap drops, and it arrives with
the lines on BOTH sides that say whose words they are.

Only lane-exited drops the prompt noise a removed worktree repeats
(`^Hook failed:` and `^bash: cd: ...: No such file or directory`), which
would otherwise be the whole payload of a lane that deleted its own tree; the
shell drawing those has the terminal back only once the harness is gone, so
no other kind can carry them. A slice that is nothing but that noise prints
`payload-noise-only lines=N` in place of the block, so silence and
suppression read apart. No other payload is filtered.

The latest pr-watch attention lines close the block when any exist and the
pr-watch event did not open it. Triage
reads the live tracker list and rebuilds only acknowledged triage keys in the
first repository's OVERSEE_WATCH_STATE_DIR baseline from kept or canceled
verdicts. Lane prompts use pane and turn.

A line already delivered is not delivered again by a re-run: overseer-dead,
overseer-walled, merged, lane-asking, usage-limit, model-capacity,
lane-exited, idle-after-return, handoff, account and outside-contribution
are keyed in that baseline. A security-alert is keyed there too, and a re-run
prints it again only as report=repeat while no verdict names it. Mail is reported at least once and never lost: lane-question,
lane-notice, directive-unread and, for a directive read after its lane is
first watched, directive-read are keyed in the mail pass's own file beside
it, owner-note, owner-ask-resolved and peer-note by the overseer mailbox's
cursor, each committed only once printed, so a stop between the two reports a line
twice: a repeated id is one already seen. A lane whose to-lane read
lane-mail reports `missed` has nothing reported or moved that pass; a cursor
below the one reported holds only its directive lines. Each repeats only when what it reports changes: another PR, a
different wall or a reset gone by, a replacement pane, a different screen, a
new record, another account state, a pull request's new head. An unchanged standing overseer-mark or refresh-failing
comes back on a timer: it is reported every ORCH_OVERSEER_MARK_REPEAT passes
while it stands, so a repeat there is the interval and never a new crossing.
A suppressed line still holds: a walled lane
stays walled, an overseer past its mark is still past it, and the
pass runs on to the remaining checks and the heartbeat. A lane mailbox read
that comes back shorter than the lines already drained from it, an empty one
included, is a read that missed lines rather than a replacement, and moves no
position: only a mailbox opening with another envelope, or one whose first
line carries no id and that holds fewer lines, is read whole again.

Options:
  --interval SECS     seconds from the start of one long pass to the start of
                      the next (default 240)

  --since ISO8601     UTC created/merged-at floor, with a Z suffix. Pass the
                      fleet's fixed start time on every run, never "now" — the
                      value names the state file, so a run given a different
                      one starts from no sightings and parks every walled lane
                      afresh; LINEAR_TEAM below arms the triage check
  --item ISSUE_ID     live item; repeatable. No values skips merged and
                      handoff with a note
  --repo OWNER/REPO   repository; repeatable and case-normalized. Every
                      check reads all of them; triage and lane rows persist
                      in the first one's baseline, mail rows in the file
                      beside it. ORCH_CONNECTED_REPOS below adds more after
                      them; with none given, the first is the repository
                      this checkout resolves to
  --hosted ITEM=REMOTE_ROOT
                      the item's lane lives on another host; its mailbox is
                      read through `lane-host` against REMOTE_ROOT rather
                      than this disk. Repeatable, once per item. An item with
                      no --hosted entry is read from `worktree path ITEM`,
                      and the project root when that reports none. The
                      clone root is learned from REMOTE_ROOT/.git and kept:
                      the item's workflow state is read from the clone, and
                      so is its mailbox once the worktree is gone. A window
                      watches the item it is named for, and gh-N watches
                      issue-N, as open-terminal names a GitHub item's lane.
                      A state record's lane is read under the host the
                      record names and routed by what that host kind
                      declares (lane-host capabilities): files=verb through
                      lane-host, files=local on this disk, files=none not
                      at all, only a channel=mailbox lane in the mail
                      pass, and the provider's status verb asked only of a
                      status=verb lane. A run carrying a lane passed with this option
                      while `lane-host resolve` answers local is refused as
                      hosted-without-host rather than read on this disk
  --root ITEM=PATH    the item's lane worktree on this disk, where its
                      mailbox is read; a lane whose worktree sits outside
                      this checkout is read nowhere else. Repeatable, once per
                      item; a --hosted entry for the same item wins
  --handoff PATH      the overseer handoff file a successor's brief names,
                      passed through to `oversee-succeed` when this watch
                      records the overseer's launch line (default
                      tmp/handoffs/OVERSEER-HANDOFF.md)
  LANE_WINDOW...      tmux window names to watch; requires $TMUX or
                      ORCH_TMUX_SESSION, which lets a watch outside tmux
                      reach the fleet's session. A bare name is a window in
                      that session, else the session this watch started in,
                      which it resolves once through $TMUX_PANE and names on
                      stderr as session-resolved, so a pane that later dies
                      moves no lane into another session; `session:window`,
                      tmux's own target form, names one in another session.
                      A bare name with no session resolved is refused as
                      session-unresolved naming the lane and the --state
                      file; a setting tmux does not hold as session-missing,
                      and a has-session call failing for any other reason,
                      no server at the socket among them, as tmux-failed
                      naming that socket
  --harness H         the OVERSEER's harness, claude, codex, copilot or pi,
                      handed to each oversee-succeed call, whose help states
                      when a pane needs it (`oversee-succeed --help`,
                      --harness)
  -- OVERSEER_FLAGS...
                      the flags the OVERSEER itself runs under — its
                      permission flags, plus its current model and effort
                      flags, regardless of ORCH_OVERSEER_PREFERENCE. These are
                      the same words `oversee-succeed -- ...` takes. This
                      watch replaces the fleet state's overseer.launch_line
                      once at startup, because a
                      dead pane can no longer be asked what it was launched
                      with. A watch started without them records a line with
                      no permission flags, and the successor it relaunches
                      stops at the first prompt nobody is there to answer.
                      A record naming this pane answers the line's harness
                      and account, and its model and effort as a pair where
                      it names a model (`oversee-succeed --help`).
                      A line this start cannot build or record is the
                      notice overseer-line-missing or overseer-unrecorded,
                      on stderr and in the fleet log, and the watch runs
                      on: the session is judged from the exit status and
                      rows file the record already holds for this pane, and
                      from the pane, the named fallback, where it names
                      none; a death relaunches from the line the fleet
                      state already holds where its record names this pane
                      by server, server start and pane id, the last line a
                      launch, a succession or a watch start recorded for
                      it, which a session restarted by hand may not have
                      been started with; a record naming another pane, or
                      none, reports the death with no successor, naming
                      that record
  --repeat SECS       the watch for a session: run one watch per pass with
                      the other options, sleep SECS after it exits, or
                      ORCH_WATCH_MAIL_INTERVAL where that is shorter and the
                      pass did not exit 2, and run the next, sooner once
                      the overseer mailbox moves. A successor launch, a
                      notice-only recovery or an exhausted retry stops the
                      repeat command with status 0. Requires --state. A
                      window that tmux does not list is carried until a pass
                      exits 0 having reported window-gone with one stderr
                      note; later passes name it --skip-lane until tmux lists
                      it again.
                      The repeat loop records itself beside the --state
                      file: its own pid, whatever launched it, the state
                      path, the pane it serves, its origin, its script and
                      directory in oversee-watch.pid, and its arguments
                      before -- in oversee-watch.argv. That record is the
                      watch's claim, which the start refusals below and a
                      succession's handover read; how an overseer launches,
                      finds and stops its watch is
                      references/watch-delivery.md's. However it is sent,
                      TERM on the loop removes the record at once, ends
                      the pass it is running and exits once that pass has;
                      a lane-close part way through is run to its end and
                      reported first, and a start that took that watch over
                      waits for it under a watch-finishing note. A start on a
                      state whose recorded watch still runs is refused as
                      watch-running naming that pid, except where that watch
                      is the one `oversee-succeed` restarted for this same
                      pane after a self-succession, or serves a pane tmux no
                      longer lists: that watch is stopped and replaced, under
                      a watch-taken-over note. Every start but a succession's
                      then prints, under a watch-replayed note, and removes
                      oversee-watch.log and oversee-watch.err beside the
                      state: what a restarted watch printed where no session
                      read it, and what the restart itself said; it removes
                      the restart's oversee-watch.runner with them. A watch
                      a succession started writes those two files, so it
                      never prints or removes them
  --state PATH        the oversee workflow-state file open-terminal records
                      every lane in (`workflow-state path oversee`), re-read
                      before every loop of the run and, in repeat mode,
                      before every pass as well. Repeat mode's automatic
                      close uses the directory containing this file. Each
                      `lanes[]` entry whose status is `running` is one
                      --item, its `window` one LANE_WINDOW when set, and its
                      `mail_root` one --hosted entry when `host` is set and
                      one --root entry otherwise, all added to any given on
                      the command line, the state's entry winning where both
                      name one item or window, so a lane launched, relaunched
                      or closed while the run loops joins or leaves it with
                      no restart. A `lanes[]` entry whose status is `parked`,
                      its sandbox stopped by `lane-close --park` with its disk
                      kept, is one --item for the merged check and the
                      lane-long age alone: its pane is gone and its mailbox
                      and state are on a stopped disk, so no other check
                      reads it, and the merge of the
                      pull request its `parked` names, in that repository,
                      prints parked-merged in the same pass and at every
                      heartbeat while the record reads parked, and closes
                      nothing.
                      The set is noted on stderr as fleet-read whenever a
                      read changes what the reader last carried, with the
                      count of records whose status is not running, so a
                      state that parses to no running lane is named rather
                      than watched in silence, and with the parked records
                      it carries for the merged check and the lane-long age:
                      a standalone run names the
                      fleet its own first read found, repeat mode names the
                      fleet it launches each pass with, and a pass names a
                      change one of its own loops found
  --skip-lane WINDOW  a lane window this run does not watch, whatever the
                      state says; its item stays watched. Repeat mode names
                      each window a pass already reported gone, so the record
                      that still carries it is not reported again every loop,
                      and hands every pass the windows given here besides.
                      Repeatable; requires --state

Exit codes:
  0  at least one EVENT line was printed
  3  overseer-dead or overseer-walled was reported and a successor took that
     overseer's
     window. This watch is done: the successor runs its own. Repeat mode
     stops on it and exits 0
  2  usage or global failure, or a lane-local mailbox, clone or
     workflow-state read failed. A lane-local
     failure is reported and the pass reads the remaining lanes before it
     exits. An unchanged lane-local failure, a provider-reported stopped state
     among them, stays quiet after its first report until a successful read or
     a different failure, and fails no run after that first one. A
     state write can fail after its event was printed. Pr-watch commits
     repository baselines in order, so earlier repository baselines may
     already have advanced when a later rename fails. Only baselines that did
     not advance repeat their events
Repeat mode prints each pass's output and ignores its exit code. It exits 2
only on a usage error, a state file it cannot read or parse, an argument a
pass would refuse (an item, a --hosted entry, a repeated --repo, a lane
outside tmux or outside any resolved session, a hosted lane with no host), a
tmux window list that fails, a watch already running on its state, a record
it cannot write, or a repeat delay it cannot sleep. TERM ends it at 143,
stopping the pass it was running and that pass's long pass; TERM is the stop
signal on every start. A watch started as a background job ignores INT from
its start, which no trap can take back; the orch job runner adds no ignore.

Which mode fits the overseer's harness:
  repeat       a harness that delivers a detached log's lines as they are
               written or holds a blocking follow of it inside the turn.
               The watch runs detached and outlives the session, so it
               reports overseer-dead
  single pass  a harness whose only wake is a background command's exit:
               each pass runs as that command and the next starts after
               every line is handled. Nothing reports overseer-dead
references/watch-delivery.md holds each harness's mechanism and re-arm rule.

When pr-watch.sh is installed, oversee-watch runs it on every pass for every
--repo; it reads GitHub's review state and writes nothing. When pr-watch.sh is
absent, the step is skipped with one stderr note.
Inside tmux, an --item with no LANE_WINDOW skips the pane checks with one
stderr note; outside tmux there is no pane to read and nothing is noted.

Environment:
  LINEAR_TEAM                 team the triage check reads under --since and

                              triage, said once, and reads the owed items from
                              open PRs; with a team a missing tracker CLI or

  ORCH_EXTERNAL_TRIAGE        `on` (default) runs the outside-contribution

                              open pull requests and the first's open issues;
                              `off` lists nothing. Any other value exits 2
  ORCH_SECURITY_ALERTS        `on` (default) runs the security-alert check on
                              every long pass, reading each --repo's open
                              Dependabot, code scanning and secret scanning
                              alerts and the fleet state's alerts_triaged
                              through OVERSEE_WATCH_WORKFLOW_STATE, which must
                              then exist; `off` lists nothing. Any other value
                              exits 2

                              credential, keeps prior rows and makes no alert

                              runs in the overseer's own checkout: each entry
                              is a watched repository after the --repo values,
                              an entry they already name skipped. Each one
                              adds its reads to every long pass, as a --repo
                              does. After a change, restart the watch: its
                              start exports the value it loaded, which every
                              repeat pass inherits. An unreadable setting
                              exits 2, in repeat mode before the first pass.

                              said once
  ORCH_OVERSEER_DEAD_PASSES   consecutive passes the overseer must read

                              poll that caught a live session between its
                              harness and its shell. A screen wall also needs
                              its account judged mark-reached
                              kind=headroom; passes alone never

  ORCH_OVERSEER_SUCCESSION    `off` leaves the overseer-dead and

                              launches no successor; `oversee-succeed` owns
                              every other value. An overseer-mark line still

                              reported. The overseer-mark judgement runs every
                              pass and reads
                              every account the fleet can launch on, under a 60
                              second ceiling where `timeout` is installed; a
                              read that passes it leaves the mark unjudged for
                              that pass, and on a host without `timeout` the
                              read runs unbounded
