# TEAR DOWN BOTH GROUPS THE CASE STARTED, AND RETURN ONLY ONCE BOTH ARE GONE.
# The injected refusal means the runtime never stops this tree, so stopping it
# is the case's own job, and the tree is two process groups: the worker leads
# one and the CLI the other, because the runtime gives every CLI a group of its
# own. Signalling `-$worker` reaches half of it, and returning as soon as the
# worker's LEADER is gone returns while the CLI half runs — with the CLI's own
# marker files still to be written at the top of $TMP_ROOT, where they land
# inside the EXIT trap's `rm -rf` and fail the suite with ENOTEMPTY.
#
# The child the CLI recorded gives the group the CLI leads, and each group is
# KILLED where it resolves, so no refusal leaves holding one it knew and did not
# signal. The worker's cannot move above that child wait: the worker is what
# forks the CLI, so killing it first means the marker never arrives under load.
#
# EVERY PID READ FAILS THE SUITE WHERE IT IS CAPTURED. `read_pid` reports
# through `fail`, whose `exit 1` ends only the command substitution it runs in,
# so an unchecked capture leaves an empty pid that `kill -- -` swallows and a
# liveness probe calls gone at once: the suite prints FAIL on stderr and exits
# 0, green to a CI lane, while the worker it failed to read leaks. That is the
# same ENOTEMPTY producer this teardown exists to end, reached by exactly the
# runtime regression the two cases below guard — one that stops calling
# stop_process_group leaves the pid file this reads absent.
#
# Every refusal here is `fail`, so this returns only on success and its callers
# are bare; a `|| fail` at a call site would also turn errexit off for this
# whole body, which is what let the unchecked capture run on in the first place.
