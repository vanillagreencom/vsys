# shellcheck shell=bash
# A PATH with named commands hidden, for the cases that must run as a host
# without them. Sourced, never run as a suite: the runners glob tests/*.sh,
# so both the subdirectory and the .bash name keep this file out of every run.
#
# Mirroring the caller's own PATH rather than listing what to keep is what
# makes the fixture rot-proof: a script that grows an additional dependency still
# finds it here, and only what was named is missing.

# One `ln` per source directory, not one per file — /usr/bin alone is a few
# thousand forks. A name already staged is skipped, which is PATH's own
# first-directory-wins rule. Nothing sets nullglob: a directory with no
# entries yields the unmatched pattern, which is not a file and is dropped by
# the same test that drops a non-executable one.
