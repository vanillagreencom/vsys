Usage: worktree <command> [ID|/path] [options]

Portable git worktree manager. Worktrees live outside the repo root at
<parent-of-checkout>/.worktrees/<checkout-name>/<id>; WORKTREE_BASE_DIR
overrides the parent directory. A hosted lane's worktree lives elsewhere
(create --help, --hosted).

Commands:
  create ID        Claim a new issue worktree. Refuses implicit reuse when a
                   worktree, branch, or PR already exists (create --help)
  restack ACTION   Guardedly continue, skip, or abort a tool-created paused
                   restack (restack --help)
  list             List all worktrees
  remove ID|PATH   Remove a worktree, clean symlinks, prune its branch
                   (remove --help)
  cleanup          Remove worktrees whose branches are merged (cleanup --help)
  path ID          Print the worktree path for an issue ID
  path --hosted    Print the one path a hosted lane's worktree takes
  exists ID        Check whether a worktree exists for an issue ID
  merged ID        Print the commit the issue tree's pull request merged as
  check            Pre-create git state check of the MAIN checkout (JSON:
                   uncommitted, unpushed); takes no arguments
  push [ID|PATH]   Push the worktree branch with auto-rebase (push --help)
  fix-links        Restore configured symlinks in a worktree (fix-links --help)
  repair-links     Git-hook-driven variant of fix-links that never destroys
                   untracked data (fix-links --help)
  codex-setup | codex-branch | codex-cleanup
                   Codex Desktop app-created worktree hooks
  claude-setup | claude-cleanup
                   Claude Code worktree hooks (WorktreeCreate)

Each mutating command's full contract is its own --help.

Path arguments and canonicalization:
  The project root resolves via git rev-parse (at any depth, inside worktrees
  too). Issue IDs that derive paths must match [A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]* and
  must not contain '..'. Issue-ID resolution prefers the configured base dir,
  then the worktree registered for the issue branch, then a hosted tree that
  records the issue (create --help, --hosted); there is no auto-migration.
  Path comparisons are canonical (physical, symlink-resolved on both sides).
  Direct path arguments for mutating commands must be registered worktrees of
  this repository's common Git directory: fix-links, codex-setup,
  codex-branch, claude-setup, and remove refuse the main checkout and foreign
  worktrees. Codex app-created worktrees are registered git
  worktrees and are accepted even outside WORKTREE_BASE_DIR.

Configuration (loaded lowest to highest: kendex.settings.toml [env], then
.kendex/settings.toml [env], then .env.local — later wins, and explicit
parent environment beats every project file; use .env.local for secrets or
personal overrides):
  WORKTREE_BASE_DIR           Parent directory for created worktrees. Relative
                              paths resolve from the main checkout; absolute
                              paths and ~ are used as-is. Default:
                              ../.worktrees/<checkout-name>, an external
                              per-repo sibling dir. Do not point it inside the
                              repo root.
  WORKTREE_HOSTED_NAME        The last segment of the path create --hosted
                              gives a new worktree (create --help); one path
                              segment in the issue-ID alphabet. Default: lane.
  WORKTREE_DEFAULT_BRANCH     Default branch name (auto-detected if unset;
                              fallback: main)
  WORKTREE_SYMLINKS           Space-separated paths symlinked from the main
                              checkout into each worktree. Point entries at
                              untracked runtime paths (an entry that shadows
                              tracked files is linked per child instead — see
                              fix-links --help). Include .env.local only if
                              worktrees should share local secrets/overrides.
  WORKTREE_RELATIVE_SYMLINKS  Space-separated path=target symlinks created
                              inside each worktree; relative targets resolve
                              from the link location.
  WORKTREE_COPIES             Space-separated files copied only from the main
                              checkout when neither checkout's Git index owns
                              them. Git-owned files stay with their checkout.
  WORKTREE_MKDIRS             Space-separated directories created inside each
                              worktree with mkdir -p (gitignored scratch dirs
                              such as tmp).
  BOT_NAME / BOT_EMAIL        git identity for worktree commits
  BOT_SIGNING_KEY             SSH signing key path
  BOT_REMOTE_NAME             Remote name for push (default: origin)
  BOT_REMOTE_URL              URL for the bot remote (added on create if set)

Same-checkout setup:
  Setup does nothing when the checkout is both the source and the destination,
  as in a standalone clone or the main checkout: every configured entry would
  act on its own source.

Setup-path hardening:
  Configured setup paths (WORKTREE_SYMLINKS, WORKTREE_COPIES, WORKTREE_MKDIRS,
  and the path side of WORKTREE_RELATIVE_SYMLINKS) must be worktree-relative
  literal paths without '.', '..', absolute, backslash, or shell glob
  metacharacter components (*, ?, [, ]). A configured symlink path cannot also
  be, contain, or parent another configured setup path. Existing symlink
  parents are rejected before writes. Copy and mkdir destinations also reject
  leaf symlinks. File and relative-symlink destinations may replace an
  existing leaf symlink or file without following it, but refuse a real
  directory leaf.

Dependencies:
  No command runs a package-manager install: installs run only in the main
  checkout, and only when the lockfile changed. Link it into each worktree
  with a WORKTREE_SYMLINKS entry for the node_modules path. A configured
  node_modules entry beside a worktree package.json always warns when its
  source is missing; a root package.json with nothing linked warns wherever
  links are set up, but not from repair-links. Limitation: linked node_modules
  resolves pnpm workspace dependencies (workspace:/link:) to main's source, so
  a worktree's checks see main's copy of sibling packages.

Session guard:
  create never claims an ownership lease — a fresh worktree is unclaimed, and
  claiming is the calling workflow's job. The lease is a native git worktree
  lock managed by worktree-session-guard (see its --help for the probe,
  release, sweep, and exit-code contract).

print_restack_help() {
  worktree_message help restack
  cat <<'EOF'
Usage: worktree restack continue|skip|abort [ID|/path]

Control a tool-created paused restack (started by create --restack, with or
without --replay).

Actions:
  continue   Continue an exact tool-created, paused restack; repeat if it
             stops again on the next conflict
  skip       Skip the current commit in that paused restack (use when the
             commit is already represented by the new base)
  abort      Abort that paused restack, restore the recorded original head,
             and clear the pending authorization; with the paused restack
             already gone, clear the record it left behind

Guarded-restack contract: while a restack is paused, the actions accept only a
registered worktree whose worktree-local restack authorization, tool-created
state token, and Git sequencer metadata agree on the exact remote, branch,
observed remote OID, original head, and target base. continue and skip re-check
the remote before and after replay, finalize the exact rewritten-head lease when
complete, and fail closed on missing, stale, or unrelated state. abort requires
that same state except HEAD's own position, which it restores, and remote
movement does not block it. With no restack paused there is no sequencer state
to agree with, so abort takes the record alone: it requires the recorded branch
to still be at its recorded original head, checks that branch out, clears the
record, and re-applies worktree setup, refusing and keeping the record when the
branch has moved or the checkout fails.

Conflicted hooks: a harness re-reads its hooks on every event, and conflict
markers in one make it fail every tool call and turn end. So when a paused
restack's conflicts include a path that a tracked harness hook declaration
runs (any JSON file whose top-level 'hooks' entries carry a 'command', such as
.claude/settings.json, .codex/hooks.json or .pi/kendex/hooks.json), that path
takes one side of the conflict, its conflicted content is saved beside it as
<path>.restack-conflict, and one 'worktree-restack-hook-held:' line names
every such path. Resolve the markers in the saved copy, then replace the path
in one step with 'mv <path>.restack-conflict <path>', stage the path, and
unstage the copy with 'git rm -q --cached --ignore-unmatch --
<path>.restack-conflict'. continue and skip refuse with
'worktree-restack-hook-unconsumed:' while a saved copy is in the worktree or
the index; deleting it, staging the path and unstaging the copy keeps the held
side. abort removes the saved copies. The held set is the paths a
declaration's command names and the libraries those hooks source, directly or
through another library, read from the '# shellcheck source=' directive above
each 'source' or '.' line, at the pre-restack head, the paused HEAD and the
commit being replayed. A directive resolves against the sourcing file's
directory; one that climbs out of it ('../skills/<skill>/...') matches every
tracked path ending in the rest of it, since the hook finds that library by
searching. When any read that discovery makes fails, the lookup of the
commit being replayed included, or jq is missing, every conflicted path is
held the same way.
Conflicts in every other path keep their markers in place.

On completion, continue and skip report one 'rebase-map: <old-sha>
<new-sha|dropped>' line per rewritten commit on stderr and append the same
lines, under a 'rebase-hop:' line of their own, to 'kendex-rebase-map' in the
worktree's git dir, the same contract the push auto-rebase reports
(push --help). A skipped commit is reported as 'dropped'. abort rewrites
nothing and reports no map.

}

print_create_help() {
  worktree_message help create
  cat <<'EOF'
Usage: worktree create <ID> [BRANCH] [options]
       worktree create <ID> --transfer <BRANCH>

Create a worktree for an issue ID (resolved under the configured worktree base
dir; default: ../.worktrees/<repo> beside the main checkout), optionally with an
explicit branch-name positional.

Bare 'create <ID>' is a new-work claim, not a discovery command. Every
new-branch mode, including --from, checks the normalized issue branch, an
explicit requested branch, and BOT_NAME/<issue> across worktrees, local/remote
refs, and open PRs. Existing ownership exits 75 and leaves local branches
unchanged — inspect or monitor owned work instead of spawning a second
implementer.
  - Origin remote-head or GitHub PR discovery failure exits 1 before any
    worktree config, branch, or target-path mutation; never interpret an
    outage as absence.
  - Unreachable secondary remotes are skipped with a warning; reachable ones
    still count as ownership signals.
  - A repository-local claim lock holds the final repeated discovery through
    'git worktree add'.
  - Run issue creates as separate commands and check each result.
  - A fresh worktree is unclaimed: create never claims a session-guard lease.

Options:
  --base BRANCH   Checkout an existing branch into the worktree; a BRANCH
                  other than the default must be on origin. One that is not
                  is refused: fetch it if it is only on another remote, then
                  push it, or `git switch` to it in the main checkout and
                  pass --transfer instead. The default branch instead starts
                  a new issue branch from it (it is always checked out in
                  the main checkout and is never issue-ownership evidence)
  --from REF      Create a new branch (named after ID) starting from REF
                  (branch, tag, or commit) after the normal ownership claim
                  gate
  --pr NUMBER     Look up the branch from a GitHub PR number (implies --base);
                  with --base, the way to inspect existing remote work whose
                  issue worktree is absent. A fork PR checks out origin's
                  refs/pull/NUMBER/head as local branch fork-pr-NUMBER, with
                  no upstream
  --reuse         Explicitly reuse an existing issue worktree: refuses a
                  foreign session-guard lease by name (exit 75), refreshes its
                  own lease in place, and skips the rebase for a tree with
                  uncommitted work. A clean tree rebases onto origin/<default>
                  and refreshes setup. The target must be registered to this
                  repository; incomplete directories are preserved (exit 75).
  --restack       When reusing, stop in the conflict state for resolution
                  instead of aborting the rebase
  --replay        With --reuse/--restack: run the same restack as an ordered
                  cherry-pick replay with no rebase porcelain, for execution
                  policies that reject 'git rebase'
  --hosted        The create runs for a hosted lane, on a clone that holds one
                  lane worktree: a new tree lands at
                  ../.worktrees/<checkout-name>/<WORKTREE_HOSTED_NAME> beside
                  the checkout whatever WORKTREE_BASE_DIR says (path
                  --hosted), the same path in every lane whose clone sits at
                  the same path, so a build there hits compile-cache entries
                  keyed by another lane's identical source path. The tree
                  records its issue, so the issue ID finds it with HEAD
                  detached. With --reuse or --restack a tree the issue already
                  has is reused where it stands; without them create refuses
                  it (exit 75) as for any existing tree. A path another
                  issue's tree holds exits 75. Without --hosted, the new tree
                  is keyed by the issue ID so several can coexist

Transfer form:
  --transfer BRANCH
                  Move BRANCH from the main checkout into this issue
                  worktree, then restore the main checkout to its default
                  branch. BRANCH must be the main checkout's current local
                  branch. Staged, unstaged and untracked changes move with it.
                  A recovery stash is kept until the transfer succeeds.
                  Do not combine --transfer with the BRANCH positional,
                  --base, --from, --pr, --reuse, --restack, or --replay.

Reuse rebase conflicts:
  Bare create never rebases an existing worktree. When the --reuse rebase
  conflicts, the run aborts it and exits 1 listing the conflicting files; the
  worktree is left clean on its pre-rebase state. Two recovery paths:
    1. Resolve in place: re-run 'create <ID> --restack'. The rebase re-runs
       and pauses in the conflict state. Resolve the listed files, stage each
       with 'git -C <path> add <file>', then 'worktree restack continue <ID>';
       repeat if it stops again. 'restack skip <ID>' drops a commit already
       represented by the new base; 'restack abort <ID>' restores the
       pre-restack branch.
    2. Discard divergence: 'remove <ID>' then 'create <ID>' recreates the
       worktree fresh from origin/<default>, losing the local commits that
       conflicted.
  With no conflict, --restack completes the same rebase as --reuse. The
  guarded actions fail closed on missing, stale, or unrelated state
  (restack --help). A conflicted path a harness runs as a hook, or a library
  such a hook sources, is held at a parseable side instead of left with
  markers (restack --help).

Rewritten commits:
  A completed --reuse/--restack rebase reports one 'rebase-map: <old-sha>
  <new-sha|dropped>' line per rewritten commit on stderr (stdout is the
  worktree path) and appends the same lines, under a 'rebase-hop:' line of
  their own, to 'kendex-rebase-map' in the worktree's git dir.
  'orch/scripts/worktree-push' applies each hop there in order to reconcile
  SHAs recorded before the restack, so restacking twice before pushing carries
  a recorded SHA through both rewrites (push --help). A base the branch already
  contains rebases nothing and reports no map.

Policy-blocked rebase (cherry-pick replay fallback):
  When an execution policy rejects top-level 'git rebase' porcelain, never
  retry the porcelain and never substitute a raw --force push. Add --replay
  to the guarded restack instead; the controls stay 'restack
  continue|skip|abort <ID>', and the tool refuses a dirty tree or a range
  containing a merge commit.

EOF
}

print_remove_help() {
  worktree_message help remove
  cat <<'EOF'
Usage: worktree remove [ID|/path]

Remove a worktree and delete its local branch when it is safely merged.
Accepts an issue ID (resolved under the configured worktree base dir, falling
back to the worktree registered for the issue branch) or a direct path.

Failure semantics:
  remove deletes the worktree before deleting the local branch. Configured
  symlinks are never pre-stripped; a refusal issued before deletion starts
  leaves the worktree, its symlinks, and its branch untouched, and Git's
  message is reported. A failure partway through can leave the worktree
  partially removed: treat a removal failure as "inspect what remains"
  (fix-links restores configured symlinks); the branch is never deleted on
  that path. A worktree still holding an unreconciled rebase map is refused
  before anything is released, removed or pruned: that map lives in the
  worktree's own git dir and would die with it, while the branch it describes
  is kept whenever it is not provably merged (push --help). The check reads the
  registration rather than the worktree, so it covers a worktree whose
  directory is already gone. Only the target registration is removed.
  A target that resolves to no registration at all is refused for the
  same reason, rather than removed on the chance that nothing is registered
  under it; a path with nothing at it is the exception, since there is nothing
  there to protect. remove checks for a native
  'git worktree lock' up front and
  exits non-zero with a diagnostic naming the lock reason and the
  'git worktree unlock' command. The branch goes only on the proof cleanup
  uses: ancestry into the default branch, or, when a squash erased that, a
  pull request gh reports merged into the default branch of THIS repository
  whose head commit IS this branch's tip. 'git branch -d' is not that proof and is not consulted —
  it deletes a branch merged into its configured UPSTREAM, which 'push' sets,
  so it passes for any pushed branch however far it is from the default
  branch. Every other answer keeps the branch, and the exit is non-zero with a
  diagnostic naming the remaining branch, the answer the proof gave, and the
  manual 'git branch -D' recovery command.

Session leases:
  remove releases its own lease before removing. A foreign lease is left
  alone and refuses the removal, naming the owner.

print_cleanup_help() {
  worktree_message help cleanup
  cat <<'EOF'
Usage: worktree cleanup [--stale] [--ttl-minutes N]
       worktree cleanup --targets-only [--apply] [--older-than-days N]
       worktree cleanup --targets-only [--apply] --worktree PATH --owner ID

Remove worktrees whose branch is already merged into origin/<default>.
A worktree held by a session guard lease is never collected — not even one
this session claimed — nor is a zero-commit worktree: a branch with no
commits of its own is pending work, not merged work. Every skip is reported;
a quiet cleanup means nothing was held back. The one exception is the
owner-scoped prune below, and it removes build output, never a worktree.

cleanup fetches origin, considers non-main registered worktrees, and proves
each branch merged two ways: ancestry into origin/<default> (or the local
default branch when the remote ref is unavailable), or, when ancestry fails,
a pull request gh reports merged into <default> in THIS repository whose
head commit IS this branch's tip. The second proof is what a squash merge needs — it rewrites the
work into a new commit, so a merged branch is an ancestor of nothing. With
merge proven, cleanup asks Git to remove the intact worktree and deletes the
local branch.

A non-empty worktree-private 'kendex-rebase-map' keeps the worktree and branch
until orch consumes the rewrite record. The skip starts with
'worktree-cleanup-rebase-map:' and names the map file.

The proof is that commit, never the branch name. One name is reused by every
worktree an issue ever had, so a branch carrying commits past the pull request
that merged it is unmerged work: cleanup keeps it and says so. Anything short
of a proof keeps the worktree and names its reason, a lookup that cannot
answer included. If the worktree listing itself fails, cleanup exits nonzero
having inspected nothing, rather than reporting the empty sweep as a clean
one. If Git cannot remove a worktree, cleanup exits nonzero and preserves its
path, configured symlinks, and branch for manual recovery. If branch deletion
fails after worktree removal, cleanup also exits nonzero and names the
remaining branch.

--targets-only reclaims build output instead of removing worktrees. It keeps
every worktree, branch, and tracked and untracked source file, and never
fetches origin or proves a branch merged: build output is written by a compiler
or a package manager, so uncommitted work in a worktree is no reason to leave
its output in place. It previews by default and deletes only with --apply,
reporting bytes per output path and naming a reason for every path it keeps.

It recognizes Cargo (target/, one prunable unit per profile directory holding a
.cargo-lock, which is held while that unit is pruned and is the one file left
behind) and JavaScript (node_modules/ and .next/ beside a package.json and a
package manager's lock file, each removed whole).

Neither the marker nor the lock file has to sit at the worktree root. Each
directory carrying a marker is its own root, and a lock file in any enclosing
directory identifies it, so a workspace that writes its lock once at the root
has every package under it reclaimed. A manifest with no lock file above it
anywhere is still refused. The walk that finds these roots descends into neither
build output nor any dot-prefixed directory, .git among them, follows no symlink
out of the worktree, and stops at any directory holding a .git entry of its own.
A submodule or nested checkout is therefore reported and left alone: this
repository's index tracks it as a gitlink and knows nothing of the files in it,
so its committed source would read as untracked. A project hidden under a dotted
directory is left alone for the same reason. Either reclaims less and deletes
nothing. A repository matching no layout is a reported no-op, not an error.

What the live-build refusal is worth depends on whether the output has a lock.
A Cargo profile is pruned under its own .cargo-lock, held from before the check
until after the delete, so a build cannot start in it meanwhile. An output with
no lock file -- node_modules, .next -- has nothing to hold: its refusal is a
point-in-time scan of running processes, taken once during inspection and again
immediately before the delete. That narrows the window to the gap between the
second scan and the first unlink. It does not close it, and nothing can while no
observable lock exists: a package manager that starts inside that gap, or during
a multi-second recursive delete, is not seen. Run --apply when no install is
expected, or leave the worktree claimed, which refuses it outright.

A delete that fails partway names its unit in a prune-failed record and stops
the sweep there; the units already pruned keep their records.

Reported bytes are what the sweep would actually free. A hardlinked file counts
only once every link to it is inside what this sweep prunes, so a pnpm
node_modules linked from a global store reports the space its removal returns
rather than the size of the tree.

It keeps an output path, naming the reason, when the path is a symlink, is not
a directory, resolves outside the worktree, or has tracked content under it;
when a Cargo target/ holds no profile lock for it to take; when a unit's name,
or the name of the package root holding it, carries a control byte the report
cannot carry, in which case the record names the reason without the path and
nothing under that root is touched; when the unit was written to
within the retention window, or changed under the measurement itself;
when its build lock is held or was replaced while it was being read; when a
live process holds it; and when the unit is lock-free on a platform with no
process inspection. It keeps the whole worktree when a session guard lease is
present or HEAD moves mid-run.

--worktree PATH --owner ID is the owner-scoped prune: the session holding a
worktree's lease reclaims that one worktree's build output, for example before
a round when its disk runs short. PATH must be a linked worktree of this
repository. It runs under the lease when the lease owner is ID, claims the
worktree for the delete as the sweep does when no lease is held, and refuses,
exiting 1, when another owner's lease or a lock outside the guard holds it or
HEAD moves mid-run. No retention window applies, so it takes only output a
build lock guards, the Cargo profiles under target/, and never node_modules/ or
.next/, which nothing reinstalls between rounds. Output written a minute ago is
pruned too; a profile kept for its held build lock, a live holder or a change
under the measurement fails the prune, exit 1, after the rest is reclaimed. The
lease stays with its owner afterwards.

--apply claims each worktree through the session guard for the duration of the
delete and refuses outright when that guard is unavailable; the preview needs
no lease because it writes nothing. Only this mode needs python3 and Unix
advisory file locks, and without either it refuses and deletes nothing.
An --apply that does not reach its own end, interrupted or killed, leaves its
lease behind, and the next sweep then refuses that worktree: clear it with
  worktree-session-guard release <worktree> --force
since this mode never takes --stale.

Options:
  --stale             Also collect worktrees whose guard lease is past the TTL
                      (an abandoned session). Releases the lease, then removes.
  --ttl-minutes N     Staleness horizon for --stale (default: 720)
  --targets-only      Prune build output; keep the worktree and its branch.
  --apply             Delete what the preview listed. --targets-only only.
  --older-than-days N Keep output written within N days (default: 7).
                      --targets-only only; not with --owner.
  --worktree PATH     With --owner: prune this one worktree. --targets-only only.
  --owner ID          With --worktree: the lease owner the prune acts for.

print_push_help() {
  worktree_message help push
  cat <<'EOF'
Usage: worktree push [ID|/path] [--set-upstream|-u] [--no-rebase]

Push worktree branch to remote. Auto-rebases onto origin/<default> first.
Uses BOT_REMOTE_NAME from project config if set, otherwise falls back to
origin.

Resolution: 'push ISSUE_ID' normally resolves through the configured worktree
registry. When run from a checkout whose current branch already matches the
normalized issue branch, it pushes that active checkout instead (app-created
worktrees).

Force-with-lease authorization: after the auto-rebase, the push uses a scoped
--force-with-lease pinned to the target branch OID known before the rebase.
Every verb that rewrites the branch persists the same narrowly scoped
authorization in the worktree before it rewrites: this auto-rebase, 'create
--reuse' and the supported 'create --restack' conflict-recovery flow. It
records the exact observed remote OID and the exact successfully rewritten
local head. push accepts that rewritten head or later commits built on it,
still pins the force-with-lease to the recorded remote OID, and consumes the
authorization after success. Only success consumes it: a pre-push hook that
refuses leaves the rewrite and its authorization standing, so the run that
fixes what the hook named publishes without redoing that rebase and without a
hand-run git command. A default branch that advanced since is rebased onto
again under the same authorization. A different local rewrite, remote
movement while conflict resolution is pending, or a moved remote at push time
fails closed.
Plain pushes are still used with --no-rebase.

A remote OID the local branch does not contain is
'worktree-push-remote-uncontained', and the route it names follows what the
branch holds. Where the remote carries work the branch lacks, it names the
fetch and rebase. Where the branch already carries every commit on the remote
branch under rewritten SHAs, fetching and rebasing would replay work that
rewrite superseded, so the refusal says so: no recorded authorization covers
the rewrite. Running a rewrite verb on that branch now rewrites nothing and
records nothing, so the refusal names the git push that republishes the
branch, pinned to the remote OID it read. A rewrite push or the guarded
restack recorded but could not map is refused on that record before this
check, so that route is never named for it.

rebase-map: when the auto-rebase rewrites branch commits, push prints one
'rebase-map: <old-sha> <new-sha>' line per rewritten commit on stdout
('dropped' in place of the new SHA when the replayed commit's patch was
already upstream) so callers can remap commit SHAs recorded before the rebase
(kendex#728). Commits pair by position when the pre/post counts match,
otherwise by commit subject. A push that skips the rebase, or one run with
--no-rebase, prints no map.

Those printed lines are a report, not the record. The same map is appended to
'kendex-rebase-map' in the worktree's git dir as its own hop, and that file is
what 'orch/scripts/worktree-push' reconciles from: a map only printed lives in
its reader's temporary capture, which that reader does not act on until this
process has returned and which its own exit trap then removes. A push whose
map cannot be recorded there refuses rather than publishing.

Subjects pair a group the rebase kept whole or dropped whole. Where it kept
only part of a group, which commit each one became is not derivable, and a
guess would name a real commit that is not the recorded one: push prints no
map and refuses, leaving the branch rebased and unpushed.

That rewrite outlives the refusal, and a retry would find the base already
contained, rebase nothing and derive nothing. So before any rewrite starts,
push and restack record 'rebase-unmapped: <head-about-to-be-rewritten>' in
'kendex-rebase-map' in the worktree's git dir, and clear it only once the map
is durable or the rewrite is unwound and the branch is back on that head. A
death anywhere in between, an OOM kill included, leaves the record standing,
and every later push refuses on it, --no-rebase included. Reconcile every
recorded SHA against the worktree's reflog, then remove that file to push
again; there is no flag that skips it. A rewrite whose record cannot be
written does not start, and one whose record cannot be cleared afterwards does
not publish.

Every path that rewrites branch commits reports the same map from the same
emitter: this auto-rebase, and a completed restack through 'create --reuse',
'create --restack' or 'restack continue|skip'. A restack reports its lines on
stderr, because create's stdout is the worktree path it hands its caller, and
records them the same way this auto-rebase does. Each rewrite appends its own
hop to 'kendex-rebase-map', a 'rebase-hop:' line followed by that rewrite's
map lines, and 'orch/scripts/worktree-push' applies the hops in order, one
reconciliation each: those standing before it pushes, then the one its own
push writes. It deletes the file only once every hop it read is recorded. The
hops stay separate because each reconciliation compares a record against the
value it held when that reconciliation began, so a record carried through two
rewrites needs two. A rewrite over a base its branch already contains rewrites
nothing, reports no map, and writes no hop; a restack whose map cannot be
recorded authorizes no push.

A refused push names its judge, and every judge reads a line rather than the
absence of one. A pre-push hook that publishes the commit-guards message
protocol ('pre-push: <key>=<value>' lines, a completed run ending in
'pre-push: result=<code>') is reported as 'worktree-push-hook-rejected', and
the hook's own lines below the record name what to fix. A ref git rejected
under its own '! [rejected] ... (stale info)' line, which it prints for a
failed --force-with-lease and nothing else, is 'worktree-push-rejected'.
Everything else is 'worktree-push-failed' with git's output below the record,
which is where a consumer's own half of a composed pre-push hook, or a network
or permission failure, states its cause.

GitHub auth: push and origin fetches use the GitHub skill's git-https-auth
behavior when available: if gh auth is valid, the git command gets a
temporary HTTPS rewrite and 'gh auth git-credential' config. Remote URLs and
git config are not modified. KENDEX_GITHUB_GIT_HTTPS_FALLBACK=never forces
the normal SSH path.

Options:
  -u, --set-upstream    Set upstream tracking branch
  --no-rebase           Skip auto-rebase

Any other flag is a usage error (exit 1), so a typo cannot quietly become a
default-behavior push. The ID or path may appear before or after the flags,
but only once, and it may not be empty: an empty target would fall back to
the current checkout and push something the caller never named.

print_fix_links_help() {
  worktree_message help fix-links
  cat <<'EOF'
Usage: worktree fix-links [ID|/path]
       worktree repair-links [ID|/path]

Restore configured symlinks, copies, and mkdirs in a worktree — the repair
after a manual rebase or merge that clobbered them, or after a
partially-completed remove. repair-links is the git-hook-driven variant that
never destroys untracked data and exits 0 quietly for the main checkout or an
unregistered path. Run fix-links FROM THE MAIN CHECKOUT: a worktree copy of
this script may itself be among the missing files.

Recovery routing — route by shape, not by whether 'test -L' passes:
  - An untracked-only WORKTREE_SYMLINKS entry must be a symlink. Missing, or
    a real directory instead: fix-links, from the main checkout.
  - An entry with tracked content underneath is a real directory BY DESIGN,
    holding the tracked files plus one symlink per untracked child, except
    an untracked .gitignore, which is a copy of main's file. A child
    missing its link, or itself a real path: fix-links (heals per child;
    never overwrites a child holding data git does not track — reported
    instead; the .gitignore copy is the one child it re-copies on drift).
  - A genuinely modified or corrupt TRACKED file: 'git checkout -- <path>',
    run in the checkout the file really lives in.
  'git checkout -- <entry>' is never the recovery for an untracked-only
  entry: the path holds no tracked content, so the command changes nothing
  while the link stays broken.

Exit status:
  fix-links judges the RESULT of its pass, not the repair's return codes:
  'Restored symlinks' and exit 0 only when every WORKTREE_SYMLINKS and
  WORKTREE_RELATIVE_SYMLINKS entry ended healthy — present, a symlink, and
  resolving to the target this command gives it. Anything else is named and
  the exit is non-zero: a materialized path left in place, an entry with
  no such path in the MAIN checkout (setup skips those outright), a link
  that never got created, or one pointing somewhere else. The errors that
  name fix-links as their remediation are re-triggered by exactly those
  paths, so claiming success for one loops the operator on a command that
  changed nothing.

Symlink entries that shadow tracked content:
  When a configured symlink path is a tracked FILE in the worktree branch,
  setup marks that file assume-unchanged before replacing it so 'git status'
  stays clean. Directory entries with tracked content are linked per child:
  setup does not link the parent — the entry stays a real directory, tracked
  paths stay real files git owns, and only the untracked children are
  symlinked, recursing into children that mix tracked and untracked content.
  A newly installed skill under the entry is linked on the next
  create/fix-links/auto-repair pass. One child is copied instead of linked:
  an untracked .gitignore, because git refuses to read .gitignore through
  a symlink ("unable to access ... Too many levels of symbolic links") and
  would apply none of its rules. The main checkout's file is the source:
  every pass re-copies it when the content differs, so a change on main
  reaches the worktree on the next pass and an edit made to the worktree
  copy is overwritten. Every other untracked child goes through the
  same safety check as a top-level entry: a child that has materialized as a
  real file or directory holding data git does not track, or that differs
  from the index, is reported and left in place, never overwritten. A child
  nesting deeper than 8 levels is reported the same way. Either makes setup
  fail naming the affected paths — an error from create/fix-links, a blocked
  warning from hook-driven auto-repair.
  A worktree carrying the legacy layout — a parent link over tracked
  content, tracked files underneath marked assume-unchanged — heals on the
  next fix-links or hook repair: the parent link becomes a real directory,
  the bits are cleared, and missing tracked files are restored from the
  index (locally modified ones are never touched). create --reuse/--restack
  reconcile the same layout before rebasing, and re-apply setup on every
  terminal path: success, a rebase that never started, an aborted conflict,
  restack continue, and restack abort. A --restack paused on conflicts stays
  un-shadowed; the links return when the restack finishes or aborts.

info/exclude entries:
  The ignore entry setup writes for each symlinked path goes into the COMMON
  git dir's info/exclude, which every checkout reads. When the path holds
  tracked content, setup follows the entry with '!<path>/' (a trailing-slash
  pattern matches a real directory but NOT a symlink pointing at one).
  Runtime-only paths keep the plain entry. The shape is re-evaluated on every
  create/fix-links against both indexes, either one enough.

Git-hook auto-repair:
  create and fix-links install shared post-checkout, post-merge, and
  post-rewrite hooks into the MAIN checkout's hooks directory
  ('git rev-parse --git-path hooks'), which covers every worktree and every
  harness. The hook logic lives in an owned helper file,
  hooks/kendex-worktree-autorepair, rewritten on every install; the three
  stock hooks get one marked delegating line — an existing shell hook is
  appended to, never overwritten; a non-shell or non-executable (disabled)
  hook is left alone with a warning; the append is idempotent.
  core.hooksPath is never used or modified: when it is set, the install is
  skipped with a warning — add a repair-links call to those hooks manually.
  The helper no-ops in the main checkout and in repos without the skill
  installed, and never fails the git operation it runs after. Repair
  re-asserts the configured WORKTREE_SYMLINKS entries only, with one extra
  guarantee: a materialized path holding files git does not track (untracked
  OR ignored) is never clobbered; the hook warns loudly, names the files, and
  points at manual fix-links after the data has been moved or deleted.

Usage: worktree path <ID>
       worktree exists <ID>
       worktree merged <ID>

path prints the worktree path derived for an issue ID (the configured base
dir, falling back to the worktree registered for the issue branch). exists
prints "true" when a directory exists at that path, "false" otherwise; both
print to stdout and exit 0.

merged asks whether the issue tree's work already landed, the question a
rebase cannot answer for itself: a squash merge rewrites the branch into a
fresh commit on the default branch, so the branch tip is an ancestor of
nothing and ancestry reports merged work as pending forever. The branch it
asks about is the one the issue's registered worktree has checked out, the
same branch create --reuse asks about. A registered worktree with nothing
checked out, which a paused restack leaves detached, has no such branch:
that is exit 2, not a fall back to the id's own name, which would be the
stale-ref lookup this resolution exists to stop. The id's own branch name is
used only where no worktree is registered at all. It prints the merge commit
on stdout and exits 0
when a pull request whose head is this branch's exact tip merged into the
default branch; exits 1 when none did; exits 2 when the lookup could not
answer (gh missing, gh failing, a response it cannot read). Exits 1 and 2
name their reason on stderr as worktree-unmerged or
worktree-merge-unverified. merged keeps an unanswerable lookup as its own
exit 2 rather than folding it into exit 1, so a caller that must decide
before it asks for a tree can tell the two apart.

create --reuse asks the same question before its rebase and skips the rebase
on a merged branch; create --restack and create --replay refuse there
instead, because a rebase is what they were asked for. create does not have
merged's third answer: it rebases both on a not-merged answer and on a lookup
that could not answer, recording the latter as worktree-merge-unverified,
because refusing there would disable every reuse on a machine with no gh.

App-created worktree hooks. The app (Codex Desktop, Claude Code) owns
worktree and branch creation and deletion; the setup hooks apply the same
project-local setup that create applies — env/config symlinks, configured
copies and dirs, optional bot git config and remote — inside a worktree git
has already created (default: the current directory). codex-branch
normalizes an app-managed branch name to the issue branch orch expects
before 'orch start'. The cleanup hooks are non-destructive and never remove
symlinks: mutating tracked symlink paths before the app has actually
removed the worktree can leave it dirty. Installation wiring: the worktree
skill's references/hooks.md.
