# Screenshots

```bash
.agents/skills/screenshots/scripts/shots capture --screen <name>   # one screen at every size in sizes.conf
.agents/skills/screenshots/scripts/shots compare --against main    # pairs under tmp/shots/
.agents/skills/screenshots/scripts/shots attach <pr>               # the pairs, in one comment
```

- Capture every screen the diff touches; `shots screens --diff` lists them from the changed files.
- Compare before attaching. A pair that differs by less than `SHOTS_NOISE_PCT` is not attached.
- Never capture against a real account; `shots capture` runs against the fixture account only, and refuses any other.
- Sizes are `sizes.conf`. Add a size there, never on the command line.

Rationale and history in a file loaded on every turn cost context every time; the reason goes in a decision record or a comment at `sizes.conf`, and the rule stays here.
