# Issue Description Template

```markdown
**Research**: [RESEARCH_REF]
**Decision [DXXX]**: [DECISION_PATH]
**Source**: [ORIGIN_CONTEXT]
**Reached by**: [REACH]
**Expected delta**: [N] lines
**Symptom**: [SYMPTOM]

[DESCRIPTION — 1-3 sentences: the problem and its impact]

## Requirements

* [REQUIREMENT_2]

## Context

- **Location**: `[FILE_PATH]`

## Field Mapping

| Placeholder | Source | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| `[ORIGIN_CONTEXT]` | Caller — e.g. `PR review suggestion ([found_by])`, `architecture planning` | Always include provenance |
| `[REACH]` | `create_fields.reach`, else the caller — the user action, run, check, or shipped producer that arrives at the defect; an owner-directed item names the ask | **Required on every issue** — the rule and what it refuses are [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) § Disposition; `linear.sh issues create` enforces it |
| `[N]` in **Expected delta** | Caller — the production lines the change is allowed to add; `[N] lines, [M] test lines` allows test lines too | The submit-time size check (`branch-size-check`) reads it as the branch's allowance and nothing else. Drop the line when no number is worth stating; the check then reports the counts for review |
| `[SYMPTOM]` | Caller — the run, the user, or the red check that already showed the defect | Required on a review-born filing at priority 2, which is the reported tier; drop the line otherwise |
| `[DESCRIPTION]` | `items[].description` | Use as written |
| `[REQUIREMENT_*]` | `items[].recommendation` | Use as written — already a `* bullet` list |
| `[FILE_PATH]` | `items[].location` | Backticked path. **Never line numbers**; name the function or struct |
| `[RESEARCH_REF]` / `[DXXX]` / `[DECISION_PATH]` | Input `research_ref` / `decision_ref`, else inherited from the parent's description | Top of the description; omit the line when absent |

## Rules

1. Drop any header line with no value. `**Reached by**` is not one of them: fill it, or do not create the issue — an item with nothing to name is a decline.
2. Write the body to a file with the harness file-write tool and pass `--description-file` (Linear) or `--body-file` (GitHub). Never an inline string, heredoc, or command substitution. The same flags work on update.
3. Before creating, check the governing decision — `.agents/skills/decider/scripts/decisions search "[KEYWORDS]"` — and reference it at the top. A description must not contradict an active decision.
4. Every create passes the validated final `labels[]` from the label preflight.
