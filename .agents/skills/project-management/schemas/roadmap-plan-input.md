| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `feature` | Yes | Feature name from the command |
| `research_path` | No | Findings path, null when research was skipped. When the input is a SPEC this is the spec path |
| `spec_path` | No | Set exactly when the artifact in hand — the `@[path]` input or the roadmap-plan § 1 disk match — classified as a finished, reviewed plan (roadmap-plan § Inputs): its approach and workstreams are binding on the TPM. Null otherwise |
| `origin_issue` | No | The issue that triggered this roadmap — context for the hierarchy decision, not a directive |
| `planner_handoff` | No | Technical context from a scout → planner chain. Informs placement, grouping, and ordering; bypasses no gate, approval, or creation step |
| `proposed_issues[]` | Yes | Issues collected from the specialist agents |

### Proposed Issue Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | Yes | `Verb: outcome` |
| `estimate` | Yes | 1-5 points per PR unit |
| `agent` | Yes | Source agent type |
| `labels` | No | Full issue-label set when the specialist knows the taxonomy; completed and validated before creation either way |
| `depends_on_proposed` | No | Title references to other proposed issues |
| `depends_on_existing` | No | Existing issue IDs |
| `conflicts_with` | No | Existing code or patterns this replaces |
| `breaking_changes` | No | APIs or contracts affected |
| `doc_updates` | No | Files needing documentation updates |

Each row of a specialist's response table maps to one entry: Title, Estimate, the source agent, Labels, "Depends on (proposed)", "Depends on (existing)", "Conflicts with", "Breaking changes", and "Skills/docs updates" → `doc_updates`.
