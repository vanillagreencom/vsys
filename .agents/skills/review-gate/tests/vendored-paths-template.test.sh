# Suite for templates/vendored-paths.instructions.md — the RENDER VARIANT
# block's recipe against the body it edits.
#
# The variant addresses the body by quoted prose, and a consumer applies it by
# searching for those quotes. Nothing else checks the quotes still occur, so an
# ordinary rewrap of a body paragraph silently strips the recipe of the edit
# meant to replace it, and the consumer's yield keeps text the flat rule
# forbids. That is not hypothetical: it shipped once, on the commit that
# introduced the block.
#
# The anchor rule, which is what makes this checkable: inside a numbered edit,
# a quoted string is an anchor unless the word before it is "with", in which
# case it is replacement text. Anchors wrap freely inside the block and are
# unwrapped before matching, but each must land on ONE line of the body,
# because a literal search is line-oriented and a phrase split across two body
# lines is found by neither half.
#
# The must-fail control is the shipped defect itself: edit 7's original
# unwrapped anchor, put back into a copy, must red.

# put it in quotes this pattern cannot match (typographic ones), or elide it to
# nothing (a leading ellipsis). Which of those it is does not matter downstream
