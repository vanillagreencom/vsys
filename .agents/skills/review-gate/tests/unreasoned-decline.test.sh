# Behavioral coverage for BOTH thread terms the predicate's thread jq decides,
# because one program decides them and the fixtures that separate them are the
# same fixtures. The jq is extracted from the script, not restated.
#
# unreasoned-decline counts a thread whose newest non-bot reply is a
# `Declined:` that names no mechanism — an empty reason, or nothing but
# non-reason tokens and filler.
#
# untracked-claim counts a thread whose newest non-bot reply THAT IS A
# DISPOSITION OR CARRIES A TRACK-WORD claims tracking and names no issue.
# Replies of any other kind never move it, so a thread ending in ordinary
# conversation still counts — `a reply that is neither claim nor disposition
# does not move it` is that case. A comments page the program cannot finish
# fails closed. The two terms divide the disposition space between them and a
# reply can fall in the seam, which is why `caught_by_either` below reads both
# counts rather than one.
#
# Neither verdict's consumers are here, and neither is checked by presence:
# review-writer.test.sh runs both through the writer, w8/w8b for
# unreasoned-decline and w9/w9b for untracked-claim, and pr-watch.test.sh
# runs both through the reducer under `the predicate's disposition verdicts
# reach the reducer` — the kind column, the attention exit, the stale-green
# companion and the heal dispatch.
#
# The fixtures are tests/corpus/, not literals in here, and adding a label
# starts there. Each label is paired with the real reason that must
# NOT be counted, because the test is subtraction: a label BESIDE a mechanism
# is untouched, and a check rejecting both would fail every honest decline.
#
# Both punctuations are exercised. The replies under audit were written
# without the colon, so a term that read only the punctuated form would pass
# every one of them; the probes at the bottom prove that reading is a choice
# this change made rather than something the fixtures happen to satisfy.
#
# The must-fail probes are at the bottom, each in the order the Done-when asks
# for: the verdict fires on a content-free decline first, then the same jq with
# one piece of the rule removed lets it through, so the catch belongs to that
# piece and not to the fixture.

# The two probes above iterate a hand-written corpus section, so they prove
# the entries someone already wrote down. What they cannot see is a label
# entry included to reason_left with no fixture beside it — the lists are the
# half of this term that changes most, and a new multi-word entry is exactly
# the shape the ordering fix exists to hold. So the set is derived HERE from
# the program, the same way the pass sweep derives its lines, and the section
# must cover it.
#
# The rule, and it is the file's rule rather than this script's: a multi-word
# entry strands when its FIRST word is in neither list — nothing else deletes
# the head — and at least one word after the first is missing from the OTHER
# list, the one still running ahead of the strips in that probe. When that
# pass deletes EVERY word after the head, the strip's reach walks leftward
# until it consumes the head itself and nothing is stranded, which is why
# `nothing to do` is excluded: both `to` and `do` are filler, so the strip
# lands on `nothing`. Reading the last word alone would miss a three-word
# entry with a mixed tail and demand no fixture for one that needs it.
#
# Nothing in that rule is about WHICH list an entry lives in. Both probes
# exist because both lists must run ahead of the strips, so the derivation
# runs over both alternations, each against its own ordering section. The
# filler list carries only single words today and derives nothing; that is a
# fact about its contents, not a property of it, and the day someone adds a
# phrase there this reds instead of the suite staying green.
