# The predicate hands its thread jq to `gh --jq`, and gh's regex engine is
# Go's RE2: no lookaround, at all. Every OTHER proof puts that same
# program through the LOCAL jq, whose Oniguruma accepts patterns RE2
# refuses to compile, so this is the only place the shipping engine reads
# the program at all. A lookbehind can pass local jq because it takes
# it, and every live evaluation of a PR carrying a `Declined:` reply died
# with `invalid regular expression`, leaving the writer to red without
# posting anything and the gate status frozen where it stood.
#
# This suite is the missing half: the SHIPPED program, through the SHIPPED
# engine, with no opt-in. The real `gh` (not the tests' shim) is pointed at a
# local HTTP stub, so `gh api --jq` runs with no network and no credentials,
# and its verdict for every fixture reply must equal the local jq's.
#
# Three controls, because "the outputs matched" is a claim a broken harness
# also makes:
#   1. a planted `(?<!` in the reason pass must red the RE2 run while local
#      jq stays green — the defect, reproduced on demand;
#   2. a planted `(?<!` in the untracked-claim test must red it too — that
#      regex is only ever compiled if a fixture reply reaches it, and no
#      corpus reply does;
#   3. a planted word-list edit must make the SAME comparison the assertion
#      runs report a difference — proof the differ is looking at anything.

# aggregate count two divergences could cancel inside. The corpus files are
# the fixtures here as everywhere else in this directory.

# THE TWO APPENDED REPLIES ARE COVERAGE, NOT VOCABULARY. gojq compiles a
# regex when the program reaches it, not when it parses, so this suite proves
# only the patterns a fixture actually drives. Every corpus reply opens with
# a decline, so `standing` is always a disposition, `select(disposition|not)`
# drops it, and the untracked-claim `test(...)` behind that filter is never
# compiled — a lookbehind planted there shipped green through this very
# suite. A tracking reply with no issue id and one naming an id take the arm
# in both directions. They belong here rather than in tests/corpus/, which is
# the unreasoned-decline term's contract and nothing else's.
