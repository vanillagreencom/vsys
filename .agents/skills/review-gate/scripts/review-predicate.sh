  cat <<'USAGE'
Usage: review-predicate.sh [--help | --check-config]   (otherwise env-driven,
                                                        no positional arguments)

The single source of truth for "is this PR head reviewed?". Callers:
review-writer.sh (the single writer, which converges the merge-blocking
commit status to this verdict on its evaluating legs — its merge_group leg
posts success without evaluation, post-approval by construction, and its
fork pull_request_review leg is a read-only no-op) and the repo's ungated
selftest CI job.

Env (required): GH_TOKEN (or ambient gh auth), GH_REPO, PR_NUMBER, HEAD_SHA
Env (optional): PR_AUTHOR — resolved from the PR when empty.

Output: one machine-readable line on stdout:
  verdict=approved|awaiting|threads-open|changes-requested|untracked-claim|
          unreasoned-decline detail=<human text>
(diagnostic detail also echoed for logs).

Exit codes:
  0  evaluated (the verdict line is authoritative)
  2  an evidence read failed or the configuration is invalid; NO verdict was
     reached. Callers must treat this as "take no action", never as awaiting:
     acting on a transient API failure could flip a healthy PR's merge state.

--check-config resolves and validates every setting below, prints one line,
and exits WITHOUT reading any evidence or requiring GH_REPO / PR_NUMBER /
HEAD_SHA: 0 = every value is legal, 2 = a value is not (the ::error names
it). It is the settings half of validate.sh, which adds the repository-tree
and workflow-wiring checks around it. Gate mode is validated, never applied
— "off" reports a valid configuration, it does not short-circuit this flag.

Predicate: review evidence present for the CURRENT head — any of
  (a) a review OBJECT at the exact head from a non-author, non-dismissed,
      trusted login (trust list empty = any non-author) whose body is not
      the reviewer's own errored-run attestation: the reviews API has no
      errored state, so a bot review that ERRORS lands as a normal review
      row (COMMENTED) whose body says the review never ran. Like a
      skip-marked check pass it proves nothing ran — silence, routed to
      NOT-EVIDENCE, never to failure, and never a carry-forward candidate;
  (b) a trusted clean-analysis CHECK-RUN or legacy COMMIT STATUS succeeding
      on this head, whose title/summary/description carries no skip-pattern
      marker (a "pass" that says the analysis was rate limited, skipped, or
      queued proves nothing ran — silence, not approval, NOT-EVIDENCE). On
      BOTH surfaces the NEWEST row/run per name decides (statuses by list
      order, check-runs by run id — kendex#1110): an older clean success
      never outlives its reviewer's newer pending/failed round;
  (c) a trusted comment-form clean pass: an issue comment by a trusted bot
      login whose body binds the evidence to this head's sha;
  (d) the trusted operator-override (reviewer-outage) attestation status —
      substitutes for MISSING evidence only;
AND no STANDING changes-requested (each reviewer's latest decisive review
across the WHOLE PR — GitHub keeps an objection standing across pushes until
re-approval or dismissal, so that reduction is not scoped to the head;
positive evidence stays exact-head) AND zero unresolved review threads.
Changes-requested and unresolved threads always fail closed, even with
evidence present.

TWO THREAD-CONTENT TERMS ride the same read, both failing closed. A thread's
disposition is its newest non-bot reply that is a reply form or carries a
track-word. `untracked-claim` is that reply claiming tracking and naming no
issue. `unreasoned-decline` is that reply declining and naming no mechanism:
the reason is empty, or is nothing but non-reason tokens and filler. The
tokens are the labels and the freeze procedure that answer a finding without
disproving it, plus bare shas, numbers and tracker ids. Two NAME strips ride
after both word lists, both positional and neither a list: a count takes the
non-space run immediately in front of it (`lifecycle 104/104` is one phrase,
and a name's own dot, underscore or hyphen is held so `merge-queue 12/12` is
too) and a slash-joined token is a path (`tools/guard.sh` goes whole). A
token INSIDE a real reason is untouched, because the test is subtraction:
only a reply that was nothing else reduces to empty. It ends at a name
standing anywhere else — after the count, the subject of a pass-verb, a
control's own label — at a count not spelled N/N, and at a label spelled out
as a sentence. No SET of names is read: a repo names its files after the
words it writes reasons in, so a set of them bans ordinary prose.

THE CORPUS IS THE CONTRACT, NOT THIS LIST. tests/corpus/ holds what the gate
must catch, what it must pass, and that KNOWN LIMIT. Add a label by writing
the reply THERE first, as a person types it, then widen `reason_left` until
the suite is green. Write the punctuated spelling: normalization turns it to
spaces first, so "won't fix" arrives as "won t fix" and an entry spelled
`wont ?fix` never meets it. That shipped.

A DECLINE IS READ BY ITS SHAPE, NOT BY THE COLON. A reply opening with the
word declines, so "Declined, out of scope" fails exactly as the punctuated
form does. Only `unreasoned-decline` reads it that wide. The untracked-claim
term keeps the narrow `Declined:` form, because widening it there would let
"Declined under the cap, tracked separately" clear a tracking claim naming
no issue, which loosens a merge gate. What a decline must say lives in
orch's references/finding-disposition.md.

APPROVAL IS NEVER SUPERSEDED BY A LATER COMMENT. The evidence reduction is
"an accepted review row exists at head" — never "the latest review per
reviewer" — so a reviewer that posts APPROVED and then a trailing COMMENTED
on the same commit still counts as approval. Only a LATER CHANGES_REQUESTED
from the same login withdraws it (and the separate changes-requested term
fails the gate then anyway). The selftest pins this.

Trust model: trust keys on NAMES ONLY GITHUB CONTROLS — the author login of
a review or comment (exact match on the app's bot login) or the exact
context/name of a check/status on repos where every publisher is trusted. A
comment BODY is never trusted to establish trust; it is read only to BIND
the evidence to a specific commit, so a stale comment cannot vouch for a
later push.

                                            not that a review happened.
                                            Unknown values are a config error

                                            silently disable a merge gate

Carry-forward engine:
  REVIEW_GATE_CARRY_FORWARD    Carry-safe delta classes ('docs', 'comments',
      'vendored'; ';' or '|' separated; empty = off — exact-head evidence
      only). When NO evidence exists at head, a qualifying review object at
      an ancestor commit N still satisfies the evidence term if the N->head
      diff classifies ENTIRELY into the enabled classes, or the trees are
      identical. Classes: 'docs' = docs-only files (*.md / *.markdown by
      extension); 'comments' = comment-only changes to code files
      (per-extension comment-token table; added/removed/renamed files,
      patch-less files, and unknown extensions refuse); 'vendored' = files
      under a path REVIEW_GATE_VENDORED_PATHS names, whatever their
      extension or status — the repository's committed kendex render trees,
      trusted as kendex output without review of their bytes (so a
      hand-edit under one rides; keep policy-bearing paths in
      REVIEW_GATE_CARRY_FORWARD_EXCLUDE, which outranks the class). Only
      the NEWEST ancestor candidate decides. A delta at the compare API's
      300-file cap refuses carry. Never a waiver: real evidence must exist,
      and only EXTENDS across a delta a review would not re-examine; code
      changes OUTSIDE the enabled classes require fresh evidence, and
      changes-requested / unresolved threads still fail closed with carried
      evidence. The 'comments' classifier is line-lexical (blind to
      heredocs and multiline strings) — enable it only where that residual
      risk is acceptable.
  REVIEW_GATE_VENDORED_PATHS    Path globs (';'-separated; the exclusion
      grammar and matcher) naming the kendex render trees the 'vendored'
      class carries, e.g. '.agents/*;.claude/skills/*'. Read from the
      default-branch checkout like every setting, so the PR under judgment
      cannot widen it; a rename carries only with BOTH names under the set.
      Configuration errors (exit 2): an unsupported spelling, the class
      enabled over an empty set, an entry naming no literal path ('*/*').
  REVIEW_GATE_CARRY_FORWARD_EXCLUDE    Path globs (';'-separated,
      shell-style; '*' matches '/' too — fnmatch without FNM_PATHNAME) that
      disqualify a carry: any file in the N->head delta matching an
      exclusion forces fresh evidence even when the delta classifies
      carry-safe — for policy-bearing files the classes would otherwise
      carry (AGENTS.md and other agent/reviewer instruction markdown —
      kendex#1115). Empty = no exclusions. Identical-tree carries are
      unaffected (no delta, nothing to exclude). Inert while
      REVIEW_GATE_CARRY_FORWARD is empty. The pattern GRAMMAR is closed:
      path characters plus '*', matched against repository-relative names.
      Anything else is a configuration error (exit 2), here and under
      --check-config — the '[', ']', '\' and '?' metacharacters, and a
      leading '/', a trailing '/', or a '.', '..' or empty path component,
      which no such name carries. The refusal runs before any evaluation, so
      a rejected spelling never reaches the matcher.

Render-only lane:
  REVIEW_GATE_RENDER_PATHS    Path globs (';'-separated; the exclusion
      grammar and matcher) naming the harness render trees a repo commits
      as kendex output, e.g. '.agents/*;.claude/*;AGENTS.md;
      kendex.lock.json'. A PR whose ENTIRE diff — the compare of the PR's
      base tip against HEAD_SHA, the merge-base diff, bound to the head like
      every read — sits under the set is approved with NO review evidence: the
      bytes are kendex output no review re-examines, and the merge still
      waits on the required CI checks (this gate never reads CI). Empty (the
      default) disables the lane. Consulted only when no evidence form and
      no carry opened the evidence term, so a reviewed head pays no diff
      read. Classification FAILS CLOSED, and every refusal takes the NORMAL
      gate path (awaiting, unless evidence exists) rather than exit 2 — a
      lane that cannot decide is a lane that is off: a PR read yielding no
      full base sha; a compare read that fails, returns zero bytes or
      malformed pages; a diff of zero files; a list at the compare API's
      300-file cap (completeness unprovable); a filename with
      control characters (line-based matching unprovable); a rename whose
      source is missing or outside the set; any file outside the set. A
      standing changes-requested and unresolved threads fail closed with the
      lane as with every evidence form. Not a carry class:
      REVIEW_GATE_CARRY_FORWARD_EXCLUDE does not apply, the set is judged
      alone, so a policy-bearing path listed here merges unreviewed. Read
      from the default-branch checkout like every setting, so the PR under
      judgment cannot widen it. Configuration errors (exit 2, also under
      --check-config): an unsupported spelling, an entry naming no literal
      path ('*/*').

Per-invocation env seams (never settings keys):
  REVIEW_GATE_SETTINGS_FILE         Overrides the settings-file path (tests,
      or a caller resolving settings for a different checkout).
  REVIEW_GATE_STATUS_SNAPSHOT_FILE  Path to a status snapshot (JSON object
      with a 'statuses' array and a top-level 'sha' equal to HEAD_SHA)
      supplied by the CALLER; when set, the predicate evaluates
      trusted-context and override evidence against it instead of fetching
      the statuses itself. LIST-ENDPOINT ROWS ONLY: the rows must come from
      the per-commit statuses LIST endpoint (/commits/<sha>/statuses), the
      same endpoint the fetch path uses — full per-context HISTORY, real
      creator.login on every row. The combined endpoint
      (/commits/<sha>/status) is NOT a valid source: it projects
      latest-per-context (masking newer-row supersession) and serializes
      creator as null for App-posted rows, which the publisher-reject rule
      would then silently drop as not-evidence; while that list is
      configured, a row without a creator login is refused AT THE SEAM
      (exit 2). The snapshot must contain the COMPLETE status set for the
      head: a caller that paginated (heads with >100 rows) merges every
      page's rows into one array under one top-level 'sha' — a
      first-page-only snapshot would silently drop later-page evidence.
      Bound to one head at one moment (the 'sha' requirement enforces the
      binding); a snapshot for another head, or an unreadable/malformed one,
      is exit 2.

  # rebinding trap as the comment-sha binding below; the selftest's

  # Check-runs are matched by NAME, but names are not reserved: any PR
  # workflow with `checks: write` can publish a check run under ANY name
  # through the shared `github-actions` app — trusted reviewer bots publish
  # under their own app slug. A github-actions-published name-match is
  # therefore never clean-analysis evidence; rejecting it here is
  # the mechanical half of the settings doc's "only names produced by
  # trusted bots" precondition.
  #
  # SUPERSESSION IS PER SURFACE, deliberately: the check-run and commit-
  # status surfaces are independent evidence sources ("either counts" is the
  # documented contract), so a newer run on one surface does not withdraw an
  # older row on the OTHER. Cross-surface ordering has no sound key — run
  # ids and status ids live in different id spaces, and timestamps carry the
  # one-second-tie hazard both projections were built to avoid — and no
  # known reviewer publishes both surfaces under one name on one head (the
  # migration case lands as a name change or a repo settings change, both of
  # which reset trust config). A repo listing a name its reviewer publishes
  # on both surfaces accepts that either surface's newest clean row
  # satisfies the term.
  #
  # NEWEST RUN DECIDES, per name: the check-run mirror of the
  # status branch's newest-row projection below. Counting "any clean
  # success" would let a reviewer's older clean run outlive its own NEWER
  # in-progress/failed round on the same head (a bot starting a fresh
  # analysis creates a separate run; the default filter=latest projects per
  # check SUITE, and a fresh analysis is a fresh suite) and open the gate
  # on stale evidence. Ordering keys on the run id — assigned monotonically
  # at creation, present on every real API row, and immune to the
  # one-second created_at ties the status branch documents; started_at is
  # NOT used (null on queued runs, which would sort a queued fresh round
  # oldest and revive the stale success). Mirroring the status branch's
  # publisher handling: github-actions-published rows are dropped BEFORE
  # the projection (the one identity PR content can wield — a minted newer
  # row must not mask real rows, not even toward closed), while rows with
  # NO app slug at all are KEPT in the sequence — an anomalous newest row
  # reads as silence, and dropping it pre-projection would revive an older
  # success from malformed current evidence. PR content cannot produce a
  # slugless row (its runs carry the github-actions slug). The newest
  # accepted row must then itself be a clean, non-skip-filtered success;
  # anything else — in-progress (null conclusion), failure, a skip-marked
  # "pass", or a slugless anomaly — is silence, never a gate failure. The
  # ordering key is VALIDATED, not defaulted: a retained row without a
  # positive numeric id would sort as the OLDEST row, so a malformed newest
  # round could revive the older success it should mask — every real API
  # row carries the id, so its absence is a broken read (exit 2), the same
  # posture as every page-shape guard. Rows dropped for the github-actions
  # slug are excluded BEFORE validation: a minted row cannot fail the read.

  #

  # NEWEST ROW DECIDES, per context. The LIST endpoint returns the full
  # status HISTORY, not the combined endpoint's latest-per-context
  # projection — filtering for "any success" would let an old success
  # outlive a NEWER pending/failure on the same context and open the gate
  # on stale evidence (a reviewer starting a fresh round posts pending over
  # its own prior success). Publisher-rejected rows are dropped BEFORE
  # choosing the newest — a rejected creator is "not evidence either way",
  # and letting a minted row mask real rows would hand PR content a
  # close-the-gate lever it should not have (only toward closed, but still
  # not its call). Login-less ANOMALY rows are the opposite: they are NOT
  # dropped from the sequence — dropped-before-newest they would revive an
  # OLDER success (stale approval from malformed current evidence); kept,
  # an anomalous NEWEST row reads as silence. Safe against the minting
  # lever because PR content cannot produce a login-less row (its statuses
  # carry github-actions[bot], which is what the reject list names), and a
  # GitHub-side anomaly (a ghost/deleted creator) masks toward CLOSED, and
  # only until a real row supersedes it. The newest ACCEPTED row must then
  # itself be a clean success: a newest row that is pending/failure, a

# The render-only lane. A repo names the harness render trees it commits as
# kendex output in REVIEW_GATE_RENDER_PATHS; a PR whose ENTIRE diff sits
# under that set needs no review evidence, because no review re-examines
# those bytes, and the merge still waits on the required CI checks (this
# gate never reads CI). Consulted only when nothing else opened the evidence
# term, so a reviewed head pays no diff read.
#
# THE DIFF IS BOUND TO THE HEAD SHA, like every other read: the PR's own
# files endpoint returns the diff of whatever the head is at read time,
# and the writer resolves HEAD_SHA once per converge pass — a push landing
# between the two would classify head B and post the verdict on A. So the
# diff is the compare of the PR's base tip against $HEAD_SHA (the merge-base
# diff GitHub shows, two shas, the carry engine's read); the base tip comes
# from the PR read and is refused unless it is a full sha.
#
# Classification FAILS CLOSED, and every refusal takes the NORMAL gate path
# rather than exit 2: the lane is a relaxation, so a lane that cannot decide
# is a lane that is off — a diff read that fails must never leave a head
# unconverged when the normal path could still judge it. What refuses: a
# PR read that fails or yields no full base sha; a compare read that fails,
# returns zero bytes or malformed pages; a diff of zero files (nothing
# classifies a diff that is not there); a list at the compare API's
# 300-entry cap (completeness unprovable, the carry engine's posture); a
# filename with control characters (line-based matching unprovable — the
# carry engine's rule); a rename whose source is missing or outside the set
# (a rename INTO the set relocates a file the set never covered); any file
# outside the set. Changes-requested and unresolved threads fail closed
# below with the lane as with every evidence form. The exclusion list does
# not apply: the lane is not a carry, the set is judged alone, and the
# settings are read from the default-branch checkout so the PR under

# A genuine GraphQL failure must NOT fall through as unresolved threads — fail

# cannot advance, the count reports "overflow" and fails closed to
# threads-open. Same posture for a thread node whose isResolved is not a
# boolean ("malformed"): null/missing nodes must never count as resolved —
# that direction is a false approval on a merge gate.
#
# REVIEW_GATE_THREADS=off skips this read ENTIRELY and the predicate never

# is a latency optimization that costs a GraphQL read per evaluation for a

# only the thread term is disabled; evidence and changes-requested still
# fail closed exactly as before.

# A thread's disposition is its newest non-bot comment that is a Fixed in
# <sha>/Declined: reply or carries a track-word; other comments never move
# it. It is an untracked claim when it is not such a reply and names no
# Linear or GitHub issue; resolving the thread does not clear it, since the
# claimant is also the resolver. Bot comments are exempt (they quote each
# other); a missing comments field reads as none. A thread past 50 comments
# cannot be fully read in this page shape, so it fails closed as malformed.
#
# The reply forms are spelled once, above both reductions, so a change to
# what a decline is reaches both. They read different sets on purpose.
# `disposition` is the canonical colon form, and the untracked-claim term is
# the only thing it may mean: widening it there would let "Declined under the
# cap, tracked separately" clear a tracking claim naming no issue, which
# loosens a merge gate. `declined` is wider, matching any reply opening with
# the word, because the replies the second term exists to catch had no colon.
#
# A decline is a disposition only when it says what it disproves, so the
# second reduction subtracts. `reason_left` strips the reply form, the
# non-reason tokens and the words carrying no content alone; a reply whose
# reason strips to nothing is counted, which is what leaves a token INSIDE a
# real reason harmless. Widen this list from tests/corpus/, never alone.
# Punctuation normalization keeps every letter and number, not only ASCII:
# the word lists are ASCII, so a reason written in another script survives
# whole, and surviving text is residue, which is a stated reason.
#
# Tracker ids go first, while each is still one token and still uppercase:
# punctuation normalization would otherwise leave the letters behind, and
# `Declined: KEN-881` would read as a stated reason of "ken". The shape is
# the untracked-claim term's, so the two cannot disagree about what an id is.
#
# Two NAME strips ride after BOTH word lists, and both are positional rather
# than a vocabulary — no set of names is read or listed anywhere. A count
# takes the non-space run immediately in front of it, because that run is
# what was counted: "lifecycle 104/104" is one phrase and neither half says
# anything about the finding. A slash-joined token is a path, and a path is a
# name: "tools/guard" goes whole.
#
# BOTH WORD LISTS RUN FIRST, and that is load-bearing. A strip eats a whole
# run, so in front of a list it eats the TAIL of a phrase and strands the
# head: "out of scope 3/3" leaves "out" and "lifecycle is green at 104/104"
# leaves "lifecycle", and a decline this term exists to red walks through the
# gate by appending a count. The rule is one rule — a word the term deletes
# never shields the name behind it — and each list has its own section of
# tests/corpus/declines-unreasoned.txt and its own must-fail probe.
#
# The punctuation pass therefore runs ahead of both lists, so the lists read
# normalized text; but it HOLDS a dot, underscore or hyphen sitting between
# two alphanumerics, so a name is still one run when the strips look and
# "merge-queue 12/12" does not leave "merge". Every multi-word list entry
# accepts those separators for the same reason, and what the strips leave is
# flattened afterwards. Widening that hold to the apostrophe would break
# "won't fix", which the lists read as "won t fix".
#
# Both lists are bounded on ALPHANUMERICS rather than on \b for the same
# reason, so a held separator is a boundary for them as it is for the
# strips: `\b` reads `_` as a word character. The corpus section "two
# unrelated labels joined by a held separator" is what holds that.
#
# THIS PROGRAM RUNS UNDER `gh --jq`, AND THAT ENGINE IS GO'S RE2: no
# lookaround compiles. A pattern carrying one aborts the read, so this script
# exits 2, the writer prints "taking no action" and reds without posting a
# status, and the gate keeps whatever it already held. That is why a decline
# stopped a PR converging rather than turning it red. The local jq is
# Oniguruma and takes lookaround, and every other proof that runs unattended
# reads through that jq, so `(?<!` shipped here once and nothing caught it.
# The boundary is therefore spelled by `word_strip`, which consumes the
# reason in run-aligned pieces (a separator run, a listed word plus the one
# character ending it, or an unlisted run), so every match starts where the
# last ended, at a run start, the set of positions a lookbehind allows.
# The space padded onto the END is how a word in the last position meets that
# one-character boundary; nothing is asked of the left, and the closing trim
# takes both pads back. Anything included here has to compile under both
# engines, and tests/predicate-re2-engine.test.sh is what says so.
#
# Position is the only thing that separates a suite name from prose — both
# are ordinary English, so any SET of names is a word ban on whatever the
# repo happens to name its files after, and "the guard refuses this path" is
# a real reason written in three of them. What position does not reach is
# pinned in tests/corpus/declines-known-limit.txt: a name standing after the
# count, a count not spelled N/N, a path whose own segments are listed words,
# and a slash written inside a multi-word entry.
