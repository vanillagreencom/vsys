# shellcheck shell=bash
# Settings resolution for the review-gate engine. Sourced (not executed) by
# review-predicate.sh, review-writer.sh, pr-watch.sh and the selftest.
#
# Resolution order for every key read through rg_setting (the REVIEW_GATE_*
# family, plus shared keys like PR_REVIEW_WAIT_SECS):
#   1. explicit environment — a SET variable wins even when set to the empty
#      string, so a caller (or the selftest) can force "explicitly empty";
#   2. .env.local (KEY=value, quotes optional — parsed, never sourced);
#   3. .kendex/settings.toml, then the repo's committed kendex.settings.toml
#      (the [env] table's sole `KEY = "value"` assignment; an explicit
#      REVIEW_GATE_SETTINGS_FILE consults only itself);
#   4. the built-in default passed by the caller.
#
# ONE per-key exception: REVIEW_GATE_MODE skips layer 2. The local waiter
# and the CI gate must resolve that switch identically, and CI has no
# .env.local — a dotenv value could disable the wait while the gate still
# enforces. It reads environment, then the settings files, then the default.
#
# REVIEW_GATE_SETTINGS_FILE=/dev/null is the force-defaults handle and means
# NO settings source at all: layers 2-3 are skipped whole, leaving explicit
# environment variables and the built-in defaults.
#
# The parser reads the [env] table only, and inside it accepts flat
# single-line basic-string assignments whose value contains no `"` and no
# `\` — exactly the kendex settings contract, decoded identically by every
# kendex resolver. An assignment outside [env] belongs to another tool and
# is ignored; a key re-assigned inside [env], or a value in any other
# shape, fails loud below.
#
# Scripts run from the repo root in CI (workflow working directory), so the
# default settings path is relative.

# A source is skipped only when it is ABSENT. A path that exists as
# something else — directory, FIFO, socket, device — fails -f exactly like
# an absent one, and a symlink that does not resolve fails -e as well as -f,
# so -L is what sees it at all: either shape would skip a configured source
# with nothing said and let a lower-precedence value decide. The /dev/null
# force-defaults handle never reaches here — rg_setting answers it before any
# source is consulted.
