# The merge route's thread waiver: the one owner of what the reply it leaves
# says, which threads a `none` class row waives, and when a thread it resolved
# stands resolved. Two readers source this file: review-predicate.sh's thread
# term, and the github skill's pr-merge. Sourced, never run; it defines and
# runs nothing else.
#
# A waiver resolution lapses when the merge route's resolution is still the
# thread's last word and the class policy at the current head does not waive
# the thread. Its last word: the resolver's newest comment in the thread is a
# waiver reply, the merge route's own, so a reply in its words from anyone
# else neither keeps a waiver standing nor ends one. Only a waiver reply whose
# author GitHub types Bot leaves a thread waivable; a person's, in any words,
# does not. A thread someone answered and resolved again is theirs.
# review-predicate.sh's thread term and pr-merge count a lapsed waiver as an
# open thread. Readers of isResolved alone (pr-watch's threads-open, github
# pr-threads' unresolved_count, orch queue-wait's late-findings guard) see it
# as resolved until the merge route reopens it.

# The waiver reply's opening, which names the class and the head the class
# was measured at. Anchored, and the head is a whole commit SHA, so a quote of
# it inside another comment does not read as the reply.
