# Review-gate validate — the organization-standard half. Shipped by the
# kendex review-gate skill, vendored at .agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/.
#
# READ-ONLY: every GitHub call below is a GET. It answers whether the
# repository's GitHub-side settings match the organization standard. The
# standard's values (the CI and gate contexts, app, environment, secret names)
# live in ../standard.json; the rows that hold no value (organization
# source, merge queue, thread resolution, Copilot review, no classic
# protection, zero bypass actors) are fixed here. Its subject is GitHub
# state, not the checkout, so validate.sh does not run it: CI's token
# cannot read bypass actors, installations or secret names, and every such
# row would be unreadable there. The permission each row's reads need is in
# print_usage.
#
# Report protocol: ok/FAIL check=KEY value=VALUE, then indented
# explanation, the same records validate.sh prints. VALUE is the observed
# state; `unreadable` in it means a read failed, which is never a match.
# Human explanation is not parsed. Full contract: print_usage or --help.

Usage: validate-standard.sh [--environment-only | --help]   (no positional arguments)

Reports, read-only, whether THIS repository's GitHub settings match the
organization standard. standard.json in the skill holds its values. The
repository is the one `gh` resolves: GH_REPO when set, else the checkout's
remote.

--environment-only reports the environment policy and its secret names.
Adoption uses this mode without requiring organization ruleset access.

One verdict line per row, VALUE being what was observed:
  standard-ruleset-source           every effective default-branch rule comes
                                    from an organization ruleset
  standard-merge-queue              the default branch requires the merge queue
  standard-required-contexts        the required contexts are exactly the
                                    standard's ci_context and gate_context
  standard-conversation-resolution  a pull-request rule requires every review
                                    thread resolved
  standard-copilot-review           a rule requests a Copilot review
  standard-bypass-actors            no ruleset behind those rules has a bypass
                                    actor
  standard-classic-protection       the default branch has no classic branch
                                    protection beside the rulesets
  standard-ci-context               an Actions job named the standard's
                                    ci_context ran for the pull request the
                                    default branch's head merged, on its
                                    pull_request leg and on its merge_group
                                    leg. VALUE is the pull_request leg's job
                                    names; a FAIL value is one of
                                    ci-context-missing:LEG:JOBS (LEG ran no
                                    such job; JOBS is what ran, or none),
                                    merge-group-unobserved:JOBS (the
                                    pull_request leg ran CI and the head did
                                    not come through the merge queue),
                                    no-associated-pull-request or unreadable
  standard-app                      the standard's app is installed on every
                                    repository of the organization
  standard-environment              the standard's environment exists and
                                    deploys from the default branch only
  standard-environment-secrets      that environment holds every secret the
                                    standard names (names only)
  standard-secrets-outside          no other secret carries one of those names:
                                    repository Actions secrets, every
                                    organization Actions secret (shared with
                                    this repository or not), repository and
                                    organization Dependabot secrets, and
                                    every other environment of the repository

A failed read reports its row as FAIL with `unreadable` in the value, never

A token holding only repository Administration, Metadata, Actions,

bypass-actors, classic-protection, ci-context and app as unreadable, and the
Dependabot scopes of secrets-outside as unreadable.
