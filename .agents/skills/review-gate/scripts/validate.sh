#
# It is a TOOL, not a test suite. It never re-runs the engine's behavioural
# proofs — those run upstream, in the kendex repo, on every change. What it
# answers is repo-own: is the engine installed and runnable here, do this
# repo's committed REVIEW_GATE_* values resolve to legal settings, do the
# carry-forward exclusions still match something in this tree, and does the
# adopted writer workflow still meet the template's contract.
#
# Report protocol: ok/FAIL/note check=KEY value=VALUE, then indented
# explanation. The workflow peer uses the same protocol; only verdict lines
# count toward the summary. Human explanation is not parsed.

Usage: validate.sh [--help]   (no positional arguments)

Validates THIS repository's review-gate installation. Run it from anywhere
inside the repository; it resolves the repository root itself and reads the
committed settings from there.

Output: one verdict line per check.
  ok check=KEY value=VALUE    the check held
  FAIL check=KEY value=VALUE  configuration or wiring is wrong
  note check=KEY value=VALUE  informational result
VALUE uses Bash printf %q escaping. Indented explanation follows each
verdict; consumers do not parse it.

Exit codes:
  0  every check held
  1  at least one FAIL line
  2  the check could not run at all (bad arguments, not a git repository, a
     missing file the checks are derived from)

Four groups run, in this order:

  runtime     every engine script this repo needs is present, TRACKED (CI
              checks out nothing else), executable and parses under `bash -n`.
  settings    the committed file is TRACKED (CI checks out nothing else), and
              every REVIEW_GATE_* assignment is one the engine reads, spelt
              the ONE way it reads them (a bare key, then its own `=`), and
              legal. Unknown keys, per-invocation seams and repository
              variables are each named as what they are; the value rules come
              from `review-predicate.sh --check-config`, never a copy of them.
  carry       every REVIEW_GATE_CARRY_FORWARD_EXCLUDE glob matches a
              tracked path and is not universal; every prophylactic
              declaration names an active exclusion that still matches
              nothing. A value the loader refuses is a finding, never an
              empty list. Pattern SPELLING is not judged here — the engine
              owns that grammar, and `--check-config` above relays its
              verdict, so this tool cannot drift from the matcher.
  workflow    the adopted .github/workflows/ copy is still the shipped
              template, line for line — delegated to validate-workflow.sh,
              whose --help states the model and the two allowed deltas.

The environment is scrubbed of every REVIEW_GATE_* key before settings are
read: what is validated is what the repository COMMITS, not what this shell
happens to export. REVIEW_GATE_SETTINGS_FILE is honoured (it names the file
to validate) and is resolved to an absolute path first.
