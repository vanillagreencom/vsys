"""File automatic rendered-file review findings for upstream triage.

refresh-reviews supplies JSON [{root, path, body, url, line, start_line, side,
start_side}] on stdin after the trusted render proof, one row per live
unanswered review thread, root being the thread's first comment id and the
rest its REST review-comment fields. The head's generated inventory binds each
reported path. Review text is data; only the upstream verifier confirms a
defect. GitHub issue titles carry a fingerprint of the package, the path
inside its directory (none for a package the lock records under any kind but
skill), and the head lines the comment names, joined by its wording where
that text occurs more than once in the file at head (its wording alone for a
file-level or base-side comment).
The lookup counts App-authored issues in every state: GitHub issue search,
then, on the run's first miss, one read of the issues updated within its
indexing lag, plus this run's own filings.

A finding is filed upstream only where kendex report --dry-run routes its one
package to vanillagreencom/kendex with a package label. Every other finding is
not filed: a path outside the inventory, a path no single package claims (the
lock, the inventory, a Copilot .github/agents/*.agent.md render), or a package
kendex report routes elsewhere. Review text about content kendex has not
claimed is never published, and its step summary row offers no filing link.
The writer skips outdated threads before reporting. It replies as not filed
and resolves those threads. Live unfiled threads stay open and hold the run.
The consumer must answer an unclaimed finding through its trusted removal PR
or a reply, then resolve the thread by hand.

stdout is one JSON array, read by refresh-reviews: [{root, issue, note}] with
one row per input row. issue is the html_url of the upstream issue the
finding is filed under, or null when it is not filed: one of the routes above,
no Issues token or denied Issues access. note names which, and for a closed
issue its close reason: that issue is the upstream answer, so the finding adds
no issue and no evidence comment. The note
"No single kendex package claims this path" gives the reason for the writer's
upstream-unfiled record, including paths outside the inventory.
Log lines go to stderr.

--settings formats ol_preference_entries' refused and deprecated arrays from
refresh-consumer as a pull request Settings section, and its
deprecated_models array, committed `KEY = "value"` settings that pin Fable or
Astra, as a Deprecated models section. Its committed object, every
committed [env] `KEY = "value"` setting, is matched against the package's
retired-settings.json: a key listed under keys, or a value listed under
values for its key, a shipped default since replaced. Those rows and the
notes array, the change-class lines naming a consumer setting that
refresh-consumer passes once the classifier ran, form a Consumer settings
section. It reports and changes no setting. An absent array or object reads
as empty. A clean parse emits no text. It does not parse settings or
preference entries itself.
