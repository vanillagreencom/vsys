Usage: validate-workflow.sh [--adopt] [--templates-dir DIR] [--adopted-path-file FILE] | --help

Checks that THIS repository's adopted review-gate writer workflow is still
the shipped template.

A repository with no writer passes only when it posts no gate status:
REVIEW_GATE_WRITER=optional together with REVIEW_GATE_MODE=off, both read
from the environment and the committed kendex.settings.toml only, prints one
`ok check=workflow-absent` line. A tracked workflow that names the engine
outside a comment is still a writer there, and fails as
`workflow-reference-count`. REVIEW_GATE_WRITER=optional under an enforced
mode is one `FAIL check=workflow-absent-mode` line, and the default
REVIEW_GATE_WRITER=required keeps `FAIL check=workflow-count`. A writer that
is executed is checked in full whatever REVIEW_GATE_WRITER says.

--adopt re-installs the template over an adopted copy that still equals a
version of the template this repository's history shipped, so a refresh that
brought a new template lands with a matching copy. The re-install writes the
template's bytes: the copy keeps its script path and its `check_run` opt-in,
the two deltas below, and loses any comment-only edit. A copy whose code lines
equal no shipped version is a copy a person edited: it is left untouched and
named on one `FAIL check=workflow-edited` line.

The template is copied VERBATIM — it carries no per-repo values — so the
check is equality, line by line. A YAML comment-only line is dropped, and
only outside a block scalar: inside a `run: |` the lines are shell payload,
where a comment, a blank and trailing whitespace all change what runs. Two
deltas are legitimate and allowed:

  * the two `check_run` opt-in lines uncommented WHERE THE TEMPLATE CARRIES
    them — both, adjacent, or neither, since a trigger without its `types:`
    child fires on every activity type, the child alone lands under whatever
    precedes it, and the pair anywhere else is not a trigger at all; and
  * the script path each repo kind actually runs: `skills/` in the catalog,
    the vendored `.agents/skills/` in a consumer. Each rejects the other's.

Anything else is one failure naming the first divergent line, the shipped
template's git blob id on a `note check=workflow-template` line, and the
remedy: `--adopt`, or a hand re-copy where the copy was edited. Nothing here
re-derives what the workflow means, so no spelling of a change can satisfy
the check while breaking the contract.

The single-writer contract gets one check of its own, over-approximating on
purpose: no other tracked workflow may name the engine outside a comment.
An invocation has no closed set of spellings, so this counts a reference and
says only that — a second workflow naming it is something to read.

One prerequisite is REPORTED and not checked. With the `check_run` opt-in
enabled, the reviewer's check name lives in a GitHub repository variable
rather than in any file, so nothing here can read it: the note says the
variable has to be set and cannot say whether it is. A run that is otherwise
clean exits 0 with that prerequisite unverified.

--templates-dir reads refreshed template data from DIR while validators and
libraries stay with this script. Default: the templates beside this script.

--adopted-path-file writes the selected repository-relative writer path to FILE
only after all checks pass. The path has no added newline, and a writer absent
by setting writes an empty FILE. Adoption consumes this file so workflow
discovery has one owner.

Output: one verdict line per check: STATUS check=KEY value=VALUE.
STATUS is ok, FAIL or note. VALUE uses Bash printf %q escaping.
Indented explanation follows each verdict; consumers do not parse it.

Exit codes:
  0  every check held (with --adopt, after any re-install it made, which an
     `ok check=workflow-readopted` line names)
  1  at least one FAIL line
  2  the check could not run at all (bad arguments, not a git repository, no
     shipped template to compare against, a history or write failure). With
     no writer found, an unreadable or invalid REVIEW_GATE_WRITER exits 2,
     and so does REVIEW_GATE_MODE, which is read only when
     REVIEW_GATE_WRITER=optional
