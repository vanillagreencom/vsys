# Review-gate SINGLE WRITER — the one place the gate commit status is written.
# Shipped by the kendex review-gate skill and vendored into consumers at
# .agents/skills/review-gate/scripts/, invoked only by the writer workflow
# (templates/review-gate-writer.yml).
#
# THE GATE ANSWERS EXACTLY ONE QUESTION: has this head been reviewed by
# someone the repo trusts, with no standing objection and no unresolved
# threads? It evaluates review-predicate.sh and converges the gate commit
# status (context: REVIEW_GATE_CONTEXT) to that answer. Nothing else.
# (REVIEW_GATE_MODE=off changes the predicate's answer, not this writer:
# the converged status is green with a disabled-by-settings attestation.)
#
# IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT POLICE CI. Whether untested code can reach the
# default branch is branch protection's job. A gate that tries to prove "the
# tests really ran" must reverse-engineer that from run numbers, job
# conclusions and timestamps — the machinery this version deletes, and the
# source of every correctness defect found reviewing v2. ADOPTION
# PRECONDITION, one of two (references/adoption.md):
#
#   (1) RECOMMENDED — a merge queue whose required contexts include the
#       repo's test aggregate. The queue runs the suite on the MERGED result
#       and refuses the merge if it fails, so the suite runs once, against
#       the code that actually ships. Proven in the sandbox: a PR whose head
#       attempt skipped its heavy jobs, with a green gate and no proof of
#       any kind, still could not merge.
#   (2) no held-back jobs — every required check runs on every push, so
#       "skipped counts as satisfied" never arises.
#
# A repo that holds jobs back behind the gate AND has no merge queue
# satisfies neither, and untested code can merge there. That is a branch
# protection gap; this script cannot close it and does not claim to.
#
# CONVERGE-ALL, EVERY LEG: except for the merge_group leg and the fork
# read-only no-op, EVERY invocation enumerates and converges EVERY open PR.
# The writer's single concurrency group means bursts evict pending runs;
# because whichever run survives converges everyone, eviction is harmless
# rather than silently stranding the evicted events' heads until the cron.
# Per-head work
# happens in a recursive single-head invocation (PR_NUMBER + HEAD_SHA set),
# an internal contract rather than a workflow input.
#
# WRITE DISCIPLINE: two writer runs can interleave on one head, so
# before ANY success post the current gate status is RE-READ and the post is
# DEFERRED when any gate entry was created at/after this run's evaluation
# instant (that run evaluated newer state — deferring protects both the
# state and the description, which carries the audit detail); a failed
# re-read defers too, because withholding success is the fail-safe side.
# Downward posts never defer — moving toward closed is always safe. Writes are
# idempotent: when the current entry already matches state + description the
# writer no-ops, so idle cron ticks append nothing.
#
# NO FORK SPECIAL CASES: every leg that reaches this script holds a
# write-capable default-branch token, so fork heads take the same path as
# same-repo heads. The read-only exception is pull_request_review fired by a
# FORK PR. That leg never reaches this script: it
# lands on the shipped workflow's RELAY job, which flags the case, dispatches
# nothing, and exits green, so fork review evidence converges on the cron
# floor. WRITER_READ_ONLY below remains an honored input (defaulting to 0)
# for a consumer that wires some other leg straight into this script.
#
# Env (required): GH_TOKEN (or ambient gh auth), GH_REPO.
# Env (leg selection):
#   EVENT_NAME    the triggering event. "merge_group" posts the queue
#                 success (HEAD_SHA required, no PR identifiers); every
#                 other value — including empty — is equivalent. The shipped
#                 workflow reaches this script only on workflow_dispatch,
#                 schedule and merge_group; PR-attached legs relay.
#   WRITER_READ_ONLY  "1": exit 0 immediately, reading and posting nothing.
#   PR_NUMBER / HEAD_SHA / PR_AUTHOR  the INTERNAL single-head contract used
#                 by the enumeration's recursive per-PR invocation.

# in the evaluate→post gap becoming a stale approved) or its description
# (a newer success's operator-override reason replaced by a stale detail —
# the audit trail rides in the description, so it is protected like the
# state). Deferring self-heals: the next event or cron tick re-reads live
# state. Fetch and filter are SEPARATE steps: a pipe would replace gh's exit
# status with jq's, so a failed or truncated re-read could slurp to an empty
# array and report newer=0 — the exact stale-success fail-open this guard
# closes. A failed re-read defers too — and so does a MALFORMED one: the
# same non-vacuous all-arrays validation as the projection read above,
# because a whitespace-only success slurps to [] and a non-array page
# collapses through `add`, both reporting newer=0 and permitting exactly
# the stale success this guard exists to block. And `>=`, not `>`: both
# timestamps have one-second resolution, so a write landing later within
# the evaluation second compares EQUAL — deferring on equality self-heals.
#
# The re-read deliberately uses bare `gh api`, not a retry wrapper (the
# predicate's gh_read is predicate-internal): every failure mode here lands
# on the fail-safe side — a failed read defers, and the next pass retries
# from live state. In-process retries would only shave deferral latency, and
# the writer stays minimal by design.
