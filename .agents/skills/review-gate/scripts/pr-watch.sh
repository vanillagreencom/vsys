Usage: pr-watch.sh [PR# ...] [--no-evaluate] [--heal] [--awaiting-after SECS]

Reduce every open PR to normalized needs-attention lines — the
long-horizon needs-attention reducer beside the predicate (one head's
verdict) and the writer (converge the gate). One invocation answers: does
any open PR need attention RIGHT NOW?

  PR# ...            watch only these PRs (default: every open PR)
  --no-evaluate      cheap mode: skips ONLY the predicate (the expensive
                     multi-read evaluation) — the thread, queue, and
                     gate-status reads still run, so threads-open,
                     disarmed, and the threads-driven gate-stale (a green
                     gate over open threads under enforced threads — no
                     predicate needed) all fire; the verdict-driven
                     gate-stale forms, changes-requested, and
                     awaiting-stale need the predicate and do not
  --heal             on gate-stale, dispatch the writer workflow once per
                     invocation (name: PR_WATCH_WRITER_WORKFLOW, default
                     "Review gate writer")
  --awaiting-after S override the awaiting-stale threshold (default: the
                     PR_REVIEW_WAIT_SECS setting, else 900)

Attention kinds:
  threads-open       unresolved review threads — read DIRECTLY in both
                     modes, never only via the predicate (a repo running
                     REVIEW_GATE_THREADS=off gets approved verdicts with
                     threads open, and thread transitions have no webhook
                     anywhere). Counted across pages (bound: 20 pages /
                     2000 threads); past the bound, or on pagination
                     metadata that cannot advance, the count fails CLOSED
                     as attention. QUEUED PRs are annotated — a queued PR
                     needs a DEQUEUE before any fix push; GitHub rejects
                     pushes to queued branches
  changes-requested  a standing objection blocks the gate
  untracked-claim    a thread whose newest disposition reply claims
                     tracking and names no issue; only a later Fixed in
                     <sha>, Declined: <reason>, or Tracked: <issue> reply
                     clears it. Needs the predicate (evaluate mode only)
  unreasoned-decline a thread whose newest disposition reply declines and
                     names no mechanism — an empty reason, or nothing but
                     non-reason tokens (frozen, cap, round N, tests pass,
                     out of scope, pre-existing and the like). Read by
                     shape, so a decline without the colon counts too.
                     Cleared by a reply naming a passing state, a false
                     premise, or an excluded class with the fact that puts
                     it there. Needs the predicate (evaluate mode only)
  gate-stale         the predicate and the gate context's newest row
                     disagree, in either mismatch direction — the writer
                     has not converged (event missed, cron slipped). With
                     --heal, one writer dispatch per invocation self-heals
                     it
  disarmed           gate open (success) on an un-queued PR with auto-merge
                     NOT armed — mergeable, but nothing will merge it (the
                     known eviction-disarm failure mode). The line also
                     carries the size orch's branch-size-check recorded for
                     this head branch at submit (workflow state
                     `pr.size_check`): the production lines it added, the
                     allowance the issue stated and the ratio between them,
                     and the head it measured. A record of any other head
                     reads `stale`, and no record at all `unavailable`. A
                     verdict other than pass is named, so a branch over its
                     test allowance is not read off a passing production
                     ratio — read only, never re-measured, refusing nothing
  awaiting-stale     no evidence and the head has sat unreviewed longer
                     than the quiet period (PR_REVIEW_WAIT_SECS, default
                     900) — time for a manual re-review trigger or the
                     caller's on-timeout policy
  heal-dispatched    informational companion to a healed gate-stale: the
                     one bounded writer dispatch of this invocation fired
  head-moved         the head changed while this PR was being reduced —
                     the findings (or the silence) describe the OLD head;
                     re-run. Attention, not an error: the race is
                     ordinary, the response is one more poll
  error              this PR could not be evaluated (predicate exit 2 /
                     read failure) — fail LOUD, never silently skipped

A verdict of awaiting inside the quiet period, and approved+success with
auto-merge armed or queued, are healthy states and emit NOTHING — silence
on stdout means "nothing needs you", which is what makes the exit code a
cheap loop/cron predicate.

Output: one tab-separated line per finding on stdout:
  <pr-number> <TAB> <head-sha-8> <TAB> <kind> <TAB> <detail>

Exit codes:
  0  nothing needs attention
  1  at least one attention line
  2  read failure, in two shapes: per-PR failures carry `error` lines on
     stdout (attention lines may also be present), while GLOBAL failures
     (missing GH_REPO, a broken open-PR listing) report on stderr only
     with no per-PR lines — surface stderr, not just stdout

Env (required): GH_TOKEN (or ambient gh auth), GH_REPO
Env (optional): ORCH_STATE_DIR — where the disarmed line reads the submit
size record from, else tmp/ under the working directory. That is the
environment fallback orch's workflow-state honours; its --state-dir flag has
no equivalent here, so a record written under one reads unavailable. The
record is found by its own branch name, so one directory serving a fleet can
match a same-named branch in another repo — the head binding then reads that
record stale rather than as this PR's size

Consumers: orch's workflows treat this as the single state reducer for
multi-PR watching (orch's approval-wait remains the single-PR foreground
wait with on-timeout policy; orch's oversee consumes it through
oversee-watch); harness wake-up mechanisms (a monitor loop, cron, a
scheduler) wrap it in a few lines instead of re-deriving state keys per
session — the wrap-in-anything loop lives in references/adoption.md.
