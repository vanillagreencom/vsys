Usage: pr-watch.sh [PR# ...] [--awaiting-after SECS]

Reduce every open PR to normalized needs-attention lines, read from GitHub's
review state alone: unresolved review threads, the PR's reviewDecision, its
auto-merge arm and its merge-queue entry. One invocation answers: does any
open PR need attention RIGHT NOW?

  PR# ...            watch only these PRs (default: every open PR)
  --awaiting-after S override the awaiting-stale threshold (default: the
                     PR_REVIEW_WAIT_SECS setting, else 900)

Attention kinds:
  threads-open       unresolved review threads, which the base branch's
                     thread rule holds the merge on. Counted across pages
                     (bound: 20 pages / 2000 threads); past the bound, or on
                     pagination metadata that cannot advance, the count
                     fails CLOSED as attention. QUEUED PRs are annotated — a
                     queued PR needs a DEQUEUE before any fix push; GitHub
                     rejects pushes to queued branches. While a thread
                     stands, the PR reports neither disarmed nor
                     awaiting-stale: answering the thread comes first
  changes-requested  reviewDecision CHANGES_REQUESTED: a standing objection
                     holds the merge. Reported beside threads-open
  disarmed           reviewDecision APPROVED on an open, un-queued,
                     non-draft PR with auto-merge NOT armed — nothing will
                     merge it (the known eviction-disarm failure mode). A
                     PR orch's merge route takes past the queue with
                     --admin is unarmed by design until its lane's direct
                     merge attempt, so for such a PR the line reports that
                     wait, not an eviction. The
                     line also carries the size orch's branch-size-check
                     recorded for this head branch at submit (workflow state
                     `pr.size_check`): the production lines it added, the
                     allowance the issue stated and the ratio between them,
                     and the head it measured. A record of any other head
                     reads `stale`, and no record at all `unavailable`. A
                     verdict other than pass is named, so a branch over its
                     test allowance is not read off a passing production
                     ratio — read only, never re-measured, refusing nothing
  awaiting-stale     reviewDecision REVIEW_REQUIRED and the head has sat
                     unapproved longer than the quiet period
                     (PR_REVIEW_WAIT_SECS, default 900), counted from the
                     newest of the head commit, the PR's creation, and a
                     ready-for-review, reopen or re-review-request event.
                     Drafts are never reported. Time for a re-review trigger
                     or the fallback approval
  head-moved         the head changed while this PR was being reduced —
                     the findings (or the silence) describe the OLD head;
                     re-run. Attention, not an error: the race is
                     ordinary, the response is one more poll
  error              this PR could not be reduced (a read failed or
                     answered malformed data) — fail LOUD, never silently
                     skipped

REVIEW_REQUIRED inside the quiet period, and an approved PR with auto-merge
armed or queued, are healthy states and emit NOTHING — silence on stdout
means "nothing needs you", which is what makes the exit code a cheap
loop/cron predicate.

A null reviewDecision, which GitHub answers on a base no approval rule
targets (a stacked PR's base among them), is not an approval: that PR gets
neither a disarmed nor an awaiting-stale line.

Output: one tab-separated line per finding on stdout:
  <pr-number> <TAB> <head-sha-8> <TAB> <kind> <TAB> <detail>

Exit codes:
  0  nothing needs attention
  1  at least one attention line
  2  read failure, in two shapes: per-PR failures carry `error` lines on
     stdout (attention lines may also be present), while GLOBAL failures
     (missing GH_REPO, a broken open-PR listing) report on stderr only
     with no per-PR lines — surface stderr, not just stdout

Env (required): GH_TOKEN (or ambient gh auth), GH_REPO
Env (optional): ORCH_STATE_DIR — where the disarmed line reads the submit
size record from, else tmp/ under the working directory. That is the
environment fallback orch's workflow-state honours; its --state-dir flag has
no equivalent here, so a record written under one reads unavailable. The
record is found by its own branch name, so one directory serving a fleet can
match a same-named branch in another repo — the head binding then reads that
record stale rather than as this PR's size

Consumers: orch's workflows treat this as the single state reducer for
multi-PR watching (orch's approval-wait remains the single-PR foreground
wait with on-timeout policy; orch's oversee consumes it through
oversee-watch, and lane-close reads its silence before a park); harness
wake-up mechanisms (a monitor loop, cron, a scheduler) wrap it in a few
lines instead of re-deriving state keys per session — the wrap-in-anything
loop lives in references/adoption.md.
