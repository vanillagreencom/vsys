# The header state machine, pinned where excluding carriers cannot reach.
# `+++ b/<path>` is a file header only where git can have written one: inside
# the preamble a `diff --git` line opens, directly after `--- `. A hunk BODY
# spells the same shape at column 0 whenever an added line reads `++ b/<path>`,
# and an unanchored parser hands the victim's record to the carrier — the
# splitter then reopens that record and truncates the findings already
# collected for it. The carrier here is ORDINARY TEXT that content
# classification correctly refuses to exclude, so no exclusion closes this:
# only the anchor does.
#
# Both fixtures share the shape that makes the loss happen: the carrier sorts
# AFTER the victim and writes at least one row under its OWN name before
# forging, so the forged rows arrive as a second, non-adjacent group.
