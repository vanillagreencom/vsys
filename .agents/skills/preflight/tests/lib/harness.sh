# shellcheck shell=bash
# Shared counters, runner and table driver for the preflight suites.
#
# Sourced on the line after each suite's `set -euo pipefail`; this file sets
# no mode, the caller's shell owns it. The suite keeps what is its own: its
# neutral world, `TMP` and the trap that removes it, and `pf_world`, the map
# from a row's world words onto a fresh fixture in `$R`. `pf_scope_seed` is
# here because the two scope suites, split from one file, share one world.
#
# Sourced, never executed: no mode bit, per this repo's CI convention.

# `pf_scope_seed` builds every world with `git -C`, and an exported GIT_DIR,
# GIT_COMMON_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE or GIT_INDEX_FILE takes precedence over it: a
# caller carrying one would aim these fixtures at its own repository. Cleared
# here for the suites that source this file, per skills/AGENTS.md.

# One table. Rows are `label|world|argv|needs|rc|fired|says`: `world` is a
# word list the suite's `pf_world` maps onto a fresh fixture (setting `R`),
# `argv` is `-` or the preflight flags, `needs` is `-` or a token
# (`pf_needs_absent`), `rc` is exact, `fired` is the exact ordered
# `;`-separated list of finding heads the run must print (`-` for none),
# compared whole against `pf_fired`. `says` is `;`-separated fragments `$OUT`
# must carry, or `-`; it is the last field, so `read` keeps a `|` inside it.
# A `{R}` in `argv` expands to the fixture path, which the row cannot spell
# before its world is built. A row with an empty field asserts nothing and
# refuses the run, as does a `needs` token `pf_needs_absent` does not know, a
# world word `pf_world` does not know or any failure its return status
# carries; a table that asserted no row exits 2 from its own counter, so a
# fixture failure or a probe run never reads as green. `PF_TABLE_PROBE=1`
# renders each row's status, fired list and finding lines instead of
# asserting.
