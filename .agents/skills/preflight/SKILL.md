# Preflight

Run preflight in the validate step, before the project's own validation command.

```bash
.agents/skills/preflight/scripts/preflight              # vs the default branch's merge base
.agents/skills/preflight/scripts/preflight --staged     # staged changes (pre-commit)
.agents/skills/preflight/scripts/preflight --all        # every tracked file, every line
```

Fix what a finding reports; never widen a lane's exclusions to clear it.

Lanes, scopes, settings, output and exit codes are in `preflight --help`. Diff construction and the `unwired-suite`, `data-syntax` and `applied-migration-edited` glob grammars are [references/lanes.md](references/lanes.md). Hook and CI wiring is [README.md](README.md) § Wiring.
