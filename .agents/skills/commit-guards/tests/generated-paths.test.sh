# glob, no stream, no empty, newline-bearing or NUL-bearing entry, and a
# membership test is literal. Two tables: one inventory loaded, pinned by the
# exit status, the paths held afterwards and the cause (the loader's own
# clauses; jq's parse wording is jq's and is reduced to a token), one path
# asked of a loaded inventory, pinned by the answer, and one shared message
# value whose final newline must remain visible after scrubbing.
