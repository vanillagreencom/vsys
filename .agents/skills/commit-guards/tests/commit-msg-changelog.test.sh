# The changelog scripts/commit-msg says a commit owes: a commit touching the
# configured required paths writes an entry or says [no-changelog] in its
# HEADER, over a git-generated header as much as a hand-written one. What is
# TOUCHED is every path the commit's record names, both sides of a rename
# and a chmod included; what is WRITTEN is a path that gained content — a
# new or changed blob, a link that became a document, a rename's destination
# — never a deletion, a chmod or a document that became a link; and the
# collated record counts only under the release declaration. One table: a
# row builds its own repository around one staged change, runs the gate,
# and reads back the exit status and every line printed. The amend base is
# commit-msg-amend.test.sh; what a fragment must SAY is changelog-entries'.
