# Pins for scripts/commit-guards, the dispatcher: the batch runs exactly the
# checks COMMIT_GUARDS_CHECKS names, in order, each announced with the scope
# flag it takes (--all or --base REF to the full-scoped check, --staged to
# the staged-scoped ones, nothing to the rest), and aggregates fail-closed
# (any check that could not complete is exit 2 and named, any violation
# exit 1); a single check runs alone with its flags passed through; the
# check list and the scope flags are validated. Two tables: the batch,
# pinned by the exit status with every line the DISPATCHER prints (the
# step lines, the incompletion lines and the summary; a check's own lines
# are that check's suite's), and the single-check invocations, pinned by
# the exit status and the first line the named check printed.
#
# Marker words are assembled from split tokens so this file never contains
# a marker shape itself.
