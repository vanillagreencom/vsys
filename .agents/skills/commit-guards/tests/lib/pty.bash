  # path carrying a newline or a control byte, and that is a bash extension
  # /bin/sh need not parse; dash did not before 0.5.12. A legal TMPDIR would
  # then stop the session starting. Passing the paths as values rather than
  # as syntax removes the question instead of answering it.

# The deadline the session holds over ITSELF. The poll loop below is the normal
# cap, but a suite killed mid-run takes that loop with it, and `script` has
# already setsid'd this session out of every group the suite's killer could
# name — so with the cap living only on the far side, a body that never returns
# outlives the run that started it. Two such keepalives from a dead session ran
# for sixteen hours before they were killed by hand.
#
# The watchdog traps no signal, is bounded by one tick per second, and stands
# down the moment the session it guards is gone, so it can neither become the
# leak it exists to prevent nor signal a process group that was recycled after
# this one ended. On a healthy run the caller's cap fires first.
#
# `kill -9 "-PGID"`, with no `--`. This runs under /bin/sh, which is dash on
# every Debian-family host including the CI runner, and dash's kill builtin
# takes the word after the signal as a pid: `--` becomes number('-'), it prints
# `Illegal number: -`, exits 2 and reaps nothing. Measured in ubuntu:24.04. The
# bare form is a process-group target in dash, bash 3.2.57 and bash 5 alike.
# The caller-side kills below run in bash and keep their `--`.
#
# The marker beside the body file is what makes the kill provable: the caller's
# cap leaves none, so a case that finds one knows the SESSION's deadline fired
# rather than something upstream. It sits beside a path the caller chose, since
# this scratch directory is the caller's to remove and it does not survive.
