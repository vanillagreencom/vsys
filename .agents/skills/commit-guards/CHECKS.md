# commit-guards checks

What each check fails, its scopes and flags, the keys it reads, and the grammar a test pins. Invocation and hooks: [README.md](README.md); every key with its default: [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

Every check exits `0` clean, `1` violations, `2` usage, config or collection error. Scans read index content, and content decides what is read: an attributes rule cannot hide a path, and a symlink, a submodule gitlink, or a blob with a NUL in its leading bytes at a scanned path is named as unmeasured, never folded into a clean count. Excludes lists and baselines take the formats in `SKILL.md § Configuration`. A path-glob list replaces the default; an empty list is a config error; a list matching no tracked file is a clean pass.

## todo-ban

`TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX` in a marker shape fail, case-sensitively, with no baseline:

- the word at line start, after whitespace, or after a comment leader, immediately followed by `:` or `(`;
- the bare word directly after a comment leader (only whitespace between), followed by whitespace or end of line.

Comment leaders: `//`, `#`, `;`, `/*`, `<!--`. A marker immediately preceded by a backtick, a quote, or joined text matches neither shape; a space between exempts nothing.

`--staged` judges only the lines the staged diff adds, renames held to exact content (a pure move adds no line; a file that moved and changed is read whole); a first commit is judged like any other. The default judges every tracked file. `--excludes FILE` overrides `COMMIT_GUARDS_TODO_EXCLUDES`.

## byte-ceiling

A tracked file a change puts over `COMMIT_GUARDS_BYTE_CEILING_KB` (KB = 1024 bytes) fails; size is the blob's object size. An existing file already over the ceiling may stay the same size or shrink, but may not grow. Exempt by exact basename: `Cargo.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lock`, `bun.lockb`, `flake.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`, `composer.lock`, `go.sum`, `gradle.lockfile`, `packages.lock.json`, `Package.resolved`. Asset trees go in `COMMIT_GUARDS_BYTE_EXCLUDES`, overridden by `--excludes FILE`.

- `--staged` (default): files added, modified or type-changed in the staged diff, renames held to exact content.
- `--base REF`: files added, modified or type-changed since the merge-base with REF.
- `--all`: every tracked file.

The batch names the scope: `commit-guards all` hands the lane `--all`, `all --base REF` hands `--base REF`, `all --staged` hands `--staged`. A copy is an addition; symlinks and gitlinks are not sized.

## suppression-ban

Blanket suppressions fail flat, scanned by pathspec:

| Language | Pathspec | Banned shape |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | `*.rs` | `#![allow(...)]` inner attribute at line start |
| Python | `*.py` | own-line `# ruff: noqa` or `# flake8: noqa`, with or without codes |
| JS/TS | `*.js *.jsx *.ts *.tsx *.mjs *.cjs *.mts *.cts *.vue *.svelte` | bare block `/* eslint-disable */` |
| Go | `*.go` | `//nolint` alone, or `//nolint:all` |
| Biome | the JS/TS pathspec plus `*.css *.jsonc` | `biome-ignore-all`; `biome-ignore-start` with no rule or a bare `lint` or `lint/<group>` scope; `biome-ignore lint:` or `biome-ignore lint/<group>:` naming no rule |

Legal: a per-line suppression naming its lint with a reason (`# noqa: E501`, `// eslint-disable-next-line rule -- why`, `//nolint:gosec // why`, `// biome-ignore lint/<group>/<rule>: why`, a per-item Rust attribute).

The bare-allow ratchet counts reasonless `#[allow(dead_code)]` and `#[allow(unused...)]` attributes per `*.rs` file; `reason = "..."` exempts one. Counts are held to `COMMIT_GUARDS_SUPPRESSION_BASELINE`, tighten-only: a new bare allow, growth past a row, and a row looser than reality all fail. `--update` lowers or removes rows and re-checks, never adds or raises one; the first baseline is written by hand from the reported `new bare allow` lines. `--baseline FILE` and `--excludes FILE` override the baseline and `COMMIT_GUARDS_SUPPRESSION_EXCLUDES`.

Generated paths and adopted source follow [SKILL.md § Generated-file exclusions](SKILL.md#generated-file-exclusions).

## conflict-markers

Seven `<`, seven `|`, or seven `>` at column 0, followed by a space or end of line, fail in every tracked file. Indented or quoted occurrences and the seven-`=` separator do not fire. `--excludes FILE` overrides `COMMIT_GUARDS_CONFLICT_EXCLUDES`.

## changelog-entries

Ordinary runs check fragments. `--collate` also validates the destination record before writing. A path in both roles is a config error. Text that is not valid UTF-8 is a collection error naming the line.

### Fragments

Every tracked path `COMMIT_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_PATHS` matches must be:

- a real text file (a symlink, gitlink or binary blob is refused);
- placed by a pattern: a pattern is `<root...>/<section>/<name>`, its last two segments say where the section sits and its depth which paths it places, and the section directory is one of `added`, `changed`, `deprecated`, `removed`, `fixed`, `security`. `changelog.d/*/*.md` matches a deeper path but places only one at its own depth;
- exactly one Markdown list item: the first non-blank line opens with a hyphen and a space and says something, and every later non-blank line indents under it;
- within `COMMIT_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_CAP` characters.

A pattern's root is its leading run of glob-free directories (`changelog.d/*/*.md` roots at `changelog.d`); a glob-free pattern names one file and roots nowhere. Every tracked path under a root that no pattern matches is a violation, except a `README.md` directly under a root and the configured record. No matching file is a clean pass; switch the check off by dropping it from `COMMIT_GUARDS_CHECKS`.

`--collate` judges, then on a clean verdict folds each fragment into the record's `[Unreleased]` section under its section's heading, in Keep a Changelog order and filename order within a section, and deletes the fragment files and each section directory left empty. It requires `COMMIT_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_COLLATE=1` and refuses, writing nothing, when the index or working tree has staged, unstaged or non-ignored untracked changes. The record is replaced whole. The release commit is its only caller.

### The record

`COMMIT_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_RECORD` names the collation destination. Ordinary checks permit edits to its wording and headings. They do not compare it against HEAD.

- `--collate` with accepted fragments requires a tracked, regular text destination with one `## [Unreleased]` section. Section headings use the Keep a Changelog names so each fragment has a destination.
- Missing or duplicate pending sections, unclosed fences, and unknown section names refuse collation before any write.
- `COMMIT_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_COLLATE=1` authorizes `--collate` and lets `commit-msg` count a record change as the release changelog entry. It does not change fragment validation.

### Measuring one entry

Lines joined with CR stripped, whitespace runs collapsed to one space, trimmed, counted in characters (one per UTF-8 sequence). A long entry is named with its file, length and first line, C0 controls except tab, and DEL, replaced.

## prose

A calendar date (`20YY-MM-DD`) or a three- or four-digit issue number after `#` in a scanned markdown file fails. Ordinary words do not trigger this check. The issue-number shape takes no leading boundary (`<file>.md#1204` fires), and the character after the digits must be neither a digit nor a hex letter (`#12345`, `#1234ab`, `#0088cc` pass). A decision ID (`D042`) carries no `#` and never fires.

Scope is `COMMIT_GUARDS_PROSE_PATHS` minus `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_EXCLUDES`, the exclusion list the markdown lanes read, so a vendored skill under a render tree is carved out with a reason rather than by narrowing the scan. `docs/architecture/*.md` joins the default only under `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_SCOPE=all`, the switch a repository flips once its markdown is rewritten; an explicit path list is used as given. The default, each name spelled twice because `*` crosses `/` but never stands in for the separator:

```
SKILL.md */SKILL.md AGENTS.md */AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md */CLAUDE.md workflows/*.md */workflows/*.md agents/*.md */agents/*.md docs/architecture/*.md
```

The `no tracked file matches` verdict prints only when nothing was skipped.

## md-format

A scanned markdown file holds one paragraph per line and one list item per line, blank lines between paragraphs, list blocks, headings and fences, and no trailing-double-space break. `md-reflow` rewrites a file to the format.

The grammar is `scripts/lib/md-blocks.awk`'s, with the line-shape predicates in `scripts/lib/md-shapes.awk`; both lanes and the reflow read by that pair:

- Front matter (`---` on line 1 to the next `---` line) is skipped.
- A fence opens on three or more backticks or tildes (a backtick run whose info string holds a backtick opens nothing) and closes on a run of the same character at least as long, alone on its line; every line between is skipped. A fence opened inside a blockquote closes when the quote ends.
- An HTML block opens on a line whose first character is `<` followed by `!--`, `?`, `![CDATA[`, `!` and a letter, a block-level tag name (CommonMark's list plus `source`), or a complete tag alone on its line where no paragraph is open. The first four end on the line carrying `-->`, `?>`, `]]>` or `>`; the tag kinds end at the next blank line. Every line is skipped.
- A tag whose name holds `_` is a prompt section: alone on its line it opens a block to the line holding its closing tag, blank lines included, and one never closed is refused. An opener sharing its line with prose is a paragraph line; a lone closing tag is a one-line block.
- A line indented four or more columns past the innermost item's content indent (a tab counts to the next multiple of four), directly after a blank line, opens indented code; it and every following line indented as far are skipped.
- A line whose first non-blank character is `|` opens a table, as does a one-line paragraph holding `|` over a delimiter row (cells of `-` with an optional `:` at either end, separated by `|`, outer pipes optional, at least one pipe). The table runs to the next blank line; every line until then is a skipped row, except a heading, fence or thematic break, judged as itself. A table is a boundary.
- A heading is `#` to `######` followed by a space, a tab or end of line, or a `=` or `-` underline directly under a paragraph line. It needs a blank line before and after it whatever the neighbour, except a one-line HTML comment directly over it.
- A list item is `-`, `*`, `+`, `N.` or `N)` followed by a space (`* * *` and `- - -` are thematic breaks), on one line, at any indent. It needs a blank line before it unless the previous line is an item; a paragraph indented to the item's content after a blank line is a paragraph of the item.
- A definition, `[label]: destination` at line start, is a boundary; definitions stack. A `[label]:` whose destination sits on the next line is a paragraph line and its wrap.
- A thematic break (`---`, `***`, `___`, spaces allowed) is a boundary.
- A blockquote's `>` markers are stripped and its content judged by the same rules. A change of depth is a boundary, except a paragraph line at a lower depth directly under a quoted paragraph line, its lazy continuation; a heading or fence closer beside the change still needs its blank line.
- Anything else is a paragraph line.

Violations, each naming file, line and rule:

- a paragraph line directly under a paragraph or list item line;
- a heading, a fence or a list item directly under a paragraph or list line;
- a heading, or a fence closer, not followed by a blank line;
- a heading not preceded by a blank line, an HTML block line excepted;
- a paragraph or list line ending in two or more spaces;
- a CRLF line ending, after which the file is not judged.

An unterminated fence, front matter, HTML comment or prompt-section block is exit 2 naming the file and opening line.

`--staged` judges every markdown file the staged diff adds, modifies or type-changes, in full, from the index, renames held to exact content. `--all` judges every tracked file `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_PATHS` names minus `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_EXCLUDES`. With neither, `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_SCOPE` decides: `touched` is `--staged`, judging nothing when nothing is staged; `all` is `--all`. The commit batch hands the lane `--staged`.

### md-reflow

`scripts/md-reflow [--check] PATH...`, or `--staged` or `--all` with md-format's selection, rewrites the work-tree copy: the lines of a paragraph, a list item and a blockquote paragraph join with single spaces, a trailing-double-space break joins away, and a missing blank line goes before a heading, fence or list that follows a paragraph line, on both sides of a heading, and after a fence closer. Skipped blocks and one-line definitions come out byte-identical, as does a clean file; a file with no trailing newline keeps none. A rewritten file passes md-format and a second rewrite changes nothing. `--check` writes nothing and exits 1 naming each file a rewrite would change. A CRLF file, a symlink and a file holding a NUL are refused at exit 2. A PATH is taken from the current directory and must lie inside the repository.

## md-refs

A dead reference in a scanned markdown file fails. Fenced code, indented code and front matter are never read. Forms:

- A link or reference definition whose destination is relative (no scheme, no leading `/`, not `mailto:`) must name a tracked file or directory, resolved against the citing file's directory; `..` above the repository root is dead. With `#anchor`, the target must be markdown and the anchor one of its heading slugs or an explicit `<a id="...">` or `<a name="...">`; a bare `#anchor` resolves in the citing file. A definition is read only where the line begins with its `[label]:`.
- A code span holding `<path>.md § Heading` must name a tracked file with a heading equal to `Heading` case-insensitively after trimming; one holding `<path>.md#anchor` a tracked file with that slug or explicit anchor. The path resolves against the citing file's directory, then the repository root. A path alone in a code span is not judged.
- A relative markdown link followed by `§` must start with an existing heading name from that target. Matching ignores case, backticks, and emphasis markers. The heading name ends at a word boundary; prose can follow it. A section number also resolves to a heading with that number. Text routes check a heading prefix. Use an anchor link or an exact code-span citation where heading names share a prefix.
- A decision ID, `DECISION_ID_PREFIX` plus at least `DECISION_ID_WIDTH` digits bounded by non-alphanumerics, must have a tracked file `DECISIONS_DIR/<ID>-*.md`; where that directory is not tracked, IDs are not judged and the verdict says so. An ID followed by `§` also names a heading of that file, judged by the same prefix rule as a section route.

The slug is GitHub's: link syntax, code-span backticks and HTML tags reduce to their text; ASCII letters lower-case (a non-ASCII letter keeps its case); every character not a letter, digit, space, `-` or `_` is dropped; each space becomes a hyphen; a repeat takes the first free `-1`, `-2` suffix.

A source file carries the same citations outside markdown, and they are judged there too:

- The `<path>.md § Heading` form in the COMMENT TEXT of any tracked file named by `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_REFS_SOURCE_PATHS`, and in the STRING LITERALS of a TOML file as well, a quoted key among them: a manifest's text is its content, where a program's string literals are its data. Comment text and string literals come from the comments lane's extractor, so the grammars and their limits are § comments'.
- A decision ID there, but only where it carries a `§` heading, on the same rules.
- Nothing else. Outside markdown a link, a bare path and a bare decision ID are prose, and only `§` points a reader at a place in a file. The heading runs to the end of the line and the prefix rule judges it, so prose may follow it.
- One `git grep` over the index names the files this pass opens: a file whose bytes do not hold the section sign holds none of these citations, so it is counted without being read. A carrier whose content is binary is named as unmeasured, as the other lanes name theirs.

`--staged` and `--all` check every tracked file named by `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_REFS_PATHS` or `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_REFS_SOURCE_PATHS`, minus `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_EXCLUDES`. With neither flag, `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_SCOPE=touched` checks that set when any change is staged, including deletions; `all` checks it unconditionally. This includes references in unchanged documents. Callers and targets resolve against the index; a tracked path holding a newline is no link target.

## comments

A selected reference in the comment text of a scanned source file fails. `COMMIT_GUARDS_COMMENT_REFERENCE_TYPES` selects issue ids, three- or four-digit issue numbers, and calendar dates. It must name at least one type. Ordinary words do not trigger this check. Issue ids are checked only when `GH_ISSUE_PATTERN` declares a tracker pattern. An empty pattern leaves that type inactive; an ID-only scan then fails configuration. The issue id is matched as written, lowered and uppered, so a pattern written in one case matches the id in any case and a mixed-case pattern matches only its own spelling. A quoted example or backticked span inside the comment still counts. String literals and code are never judged. Each hit is reported once per line and shape. Without a tracker pattern, technical names such as `UTF-8` and `SHA-256` pass. Numeric issue references and dates remain checked by default. Each configured pattern is a POSIX ERE read by awk and `git grep`; one either tool cannot compile is exit 2.

Applied migrations are immutable first-party content; the exclusion policy is in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) § Configuration.

Optional audit lane: run `.agents/skills/commit-guards/scripts/commit-guards comments` directly when an audit is needed. Keep `comments` out of `COMMIT_GUARDS_CHECKS` so it does not block commits. Scopes are `todo-ban`'s: `--staged` judges only the lines the staged diff adds, comment state read from the whole staged blob; the default reads every tracked file `COMMIT_GUARDS_COMMENT_PATHS` names minus `COMMIT_GUARDS_COMMENT_EXCLUDES`, overridden by `--excludes FILE`. A matched path the table below gives no grammar is named as unmeasured.

Comment text is extracted per family, by extension or, for a path with none, by the interpreter its `#!` line names. The default path list is exactly these extensions, with `Makefile` and `Dockerfile` by basename at the root and below:

| Family | Extensions | Comments read | Strings tracked |
|---|---|---|---|
| C | `rs` `go` `c` `h` `cc` `cpp` `hpp` `java` `kt` `kts` `swift` `wgsl` `js` `mjs` `cjs` `jsx` `ts` `tsx` `scss` `less` | `//` `///` `//!` to end of line; `/* */` across lines | `"…"` and `'…'` with backslash escapes; a backtick template literal across lines (`go`, `js`, `ts` and their variants); Rust `r"…"`, `r#"…"#`, a string spanning lines, a char literal, and a lifetime quote that opens nothing |
| CSS | `css` | `/* */` only | `"…"` `'…'` |
| Hash | `sh` `bash` `zsh` `py` `rb` `toml` `yml` `yaml` `mk` `Makefile` `Dockerfile`; no extension with a `#!` naming an interpreter ending in `sh`, or python or ruby (`node`, `deno`, `bun` take the C family) | `#` at the start of a word (line start or after whitespace) to end of line; line 1 `#!` is not a comment | `"…"` with escapes; `'…'` without escapes in shell, TOML and YAML, with escapes in Python and Ruby; shell `$'…'` with escapes; a shell string across lines; quotes, comments and heredocs inside a double-quoted `$(…)`; Python and TOML triple quotes across lines; a shell heredoc body (`<<WORD`, `<<-WORD`; the word runs to a blank or one of `;|&<>`, its quotes stripped; `<<` inside `((…))` is a shift) up to its terminator line |
| Dash | `sql` `lua` | `--` to end of line; SQL `/* */` and Lua `--[[ ]]` across lines | `"…"` `'…'` with escapes |
| Markup | `html` `htm` `xml` `svg` `vue` `svelte` | `<!-- -->` across lines | none |

The scanner is a character walk, not a parser. Its limits, each pinned by a control in `tests/comments.test.sh`:

- A `//` inside a JavaScript regex literal, a `#` glued to a Python or TOML value (`x = 1#c`), and a `--` inside a Lua long string `[[…]]` are read by the rules above, not the language's.
- A JavaScript template literal is one string to its closing backtick; a nested template inside `${…}` is not tracked.
- A Rust nested block comment closes at the first `*/`; a Lua `--[==[` level is not tracked.
- A shell line opening two heredocs honours the first; a Ruby heredoc, a YAML block scalar (`key: |`) and a Makefile recipe's shell are read as code, so a `#` inside them is a comment.
- A Vue or Svelte file is judged for `<!-- -->` only; the `//` inside its script block is not read.
- A C or JavaScript string ends at its line (a trailing backslash continuation is not tracked); a Rust string does not.
- A file that ends inside a block comment, a heredoc body or a string spanning lines is unmeasured and names the opener's line. The remaining files are scanned before the lane exits 2. A JavaScript regex literal holding an odd number of backticks or quotes leaves the file in that state.

## commit-msg

One message, from FILE or stdin (FILE absent or `-`). Every applicable rule reports before the verdict.

- Shape: the header (the first non-blank, non-comment line) matches `type(scope)!: subject`, scope and `!` optional. Types are `COMMIT_GUARDS_COMMIT_TYPES`; the scope class `[#A-Za-z0-9 _.,/-]+` passes `fix(ABC-123):` and `fix(#123):`.
- Length: at most `COMMIT_GUARDS_SUBJECT_MAX` characters, counted as the changelog cap counts.
- Changelog: where `COMMIT_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_REQUIRED_PATHS` names a glob a changed path matches, the commit must also add or modify a path under `COMMIT_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_PATHS` or carry `[no-changelog]` in the header. Evidence is a path that comes out of the commit with content it did not carry there before (a new blob, a changed blob, a type that became a regular file, a rename destination); deleting a fragment is not writing one. `COMMIT_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_RECORD` counts only under `COMMIT_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_COLLATE=1`.

Both lists are read from `--raw` with rename detection pinned, against the parent the commit will have: HEAD, or HEAD's parent for an amend. An amend is read off the argv of the nearest `git` ancestor in `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`, only when `GIT_INDEX_FILE` says git started this hook; where nothing is readable (every macOS host) the parent is HEAD. `--amend` counts only where no value-taking option could have consumed it (`--mess --amend`, `-am --amend`, `--status --amend` are not amends); `--no-amend` counts wherever it stands; a bare `--` stops the scan. A rebase `reword` and an `edit` stop are amends; an all-`pick` rebase and an autosquash fixup are not.

Git-generated headers (Merge, Revert, Reapply, `fixup!`, `squash!`, `amend!`) skip shape and length and keep the changelog rule.
