# commit-guards development

What a maintainer must not break. What each check fails: [CHECKS.md](CHECKS.md); consumer text: [README.md](README.md); every key: [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

## One definition each

- `scripts/commit-guards` is the dispatcher; `STAGED_SCOPED_CHECKS` names the checks the commit batch hands `--staged`.
- `scripts/lib/common.sh` holds the shared helpers, the one exit handler, `gg_content_carriers` and `gg_grep_lane`.
- `scripts/lib/configured-paths.sh` holds a glob-list lane's list, excludes, matcher, index walk and `gg_note_skip`.
- `scripts/lib/staged-lines.sh` is the lines a commit adds to one path, off a pinned `-U0` diff.
- `scripts/lib/comment-text.sh` is the comment grammar per path and the `line<TAB>text` scanner; its limits are stated in CHECKS.md § comments and pinned by `tests/comments.test.sh`.
- `scripts/lib/commit-header.sh` and `changelog-grammar.sh` define what a commit header and a changelog fragment are; `commit-parent.sh` is the parent a commit will have, an amend read off `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`.
- `scripts/lib/helper-body.sh` is the exact bytes of `.git/hooks/kendex-guards` (`helper_body`, `helper_head_shape`, `gg_shell_quote`); `skill-roots.sh` is the one definition of the skills roots, including the copy baked into the helper; `hooks-path.sh` is where git reads hooks from.
- `scripts/lib/md-blocks.awk` is the one reading of a markdown file's blocks; `md-shapes.awk` the line-shape predicates it asks, always the first `-f` program of `md-format`, `md-reflow` and `md-refs`, never loaded alone; `md-refs.awk` what a file cites and defines; `md-slug.awk` a heading reduced to its GitHub anchor; `md-scope.sh` the three scopes the markdown lanes share.
- `tests/`: run any file directly; every suite sources `tests/lib/harness.bash` first (scratch root, `TMPDIR` inside it, git-config isolation). `tests/lib/install-hooks.bash` is the fixture repository the installer suites share; `tests/lib/pty.bash` is sourced by `tests/terminal-paths.test.sh` alone.

## Design

- Exit contract: `0` clean, `1` violations, `2` usage, config or collection error. A failed measurement is exit 2, never a pass.
- Scans read index content, so the gate judges what is committed and a sparse checkout hides nothing.
- Content decides what is scannable; an attribute never does. Listings force text (`--text`, no `-I`), diffs pin `--no-ext-diff --no-textconv --no-color --text`, and each named blob is sniffed for a NUL in its first block.
- `gg_content_carriers` lists the measurable carriers and `gg_grep_lane` details the hits; both force text and move together, since a file the listing names and the detail scan drops is a spurious exit 2.
- Every skip goes through `gg_note_skip` and is counted in `GG_WALK_SKIPPED` by distinct path; each verdict line carries `N matched path(s) not measured`.
- A check that refuses states what it refused, why, and the preferred remedy first, before any exemption path; every exclusion carries its reason; a tighten-only baseline exists only where legacy counts exist.
- A remedy is data, never a pasteable command line.

## Git hook install contract

The installer writes into `.git/hooks`, never `core.hooksPath`:

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `kendex-guards` | Helper the installer owns and rewrites on every run. |
| `pre-commit` | One marked line delegating to the helper, created, or inserted after the shebang of an existing hook. |
| `commit-msg` | Same, passing git's message file through. |

- The delegating line goes first (hook content ending in `exit` would leave an appended line unreachable), blocks on any nonzero, and falls through to the hook's own content, whose exit status still decides.
- Repeat runs are no-ops and repairs: only the exact line on a line of its own is current; a cleared executable bit is restored.
- Left alone, reported, exit 1: a symlinked or non-executable hook; a shebang naming a non-POSIX-shell interpreter, an `env` lookup, an interpreter option, or a shell outside the trusted full paths under `/bin` and `/usr/bin`. A helper file this installer did not write is never overwritten. A bare repository is refused.
- `core.hooksPath` set to anything makes install a reported skip; removal and `--check` still run. `hooks_path_origins` prints the stand-down on stderr: git's `--show-origin --show-scope --get-all` lines verbatim through `%q`, and one sentence naming no path and no command.
- Linked worktrees share one install, and arming is refused in one: the helper names the scripts directory of the tree that armed it, which every session in the repository would then run and which goes away with that tree. The refusal stands down where there is no main checkout to name — a bare repository with work trees added — and it stands behind the `core.hooksPath` skip, which writes nothing from anywhere. `--check` and `--uninstall` answer from any work tree, and `--check`'s re-arm remedy names the main checkout where the caller is not standing in it; all of them, and arming from the main checkout, are repository-level and ask no other work tree or project.
- `--uninstall` drops the helper and the marked line, deletes a hook file this installer created outright, leaves every other line, and runs under `core.hooksPath` too. A line it may not edit keeps the helper and fails the removal.
- `--check` writes nothing, not even the hooks directory. `0`: helper and both hooks pass the install predicate. `1`: a shim drifted or absent, or `core.hooksPath` set and empty. `2`: unmeasurable, or `core.hooksPath` naming a directory; the verifier reads `.git/hooks` only. Definitive drift outranks an unmeasured component. One stdout line carries every finding.
- The helper is compared byte for byte against `helper_body`, its head against `helper_head_shape` with the per-checkout value blanked. Only `SCRIPT_DIR` may differ, and only when it round-trips through `gg_shell_quote` and names this project's scripts directory in another checkout of this repository; `project_rel` and `skill_roots` compare exactly.
- `gg_install_file` in `scripts/lib/atomic-install.sh` replaces baselines, collated changelogs, and reflowed markdown by a rename inside the destination's directory. `common.sh` removes its staging file on exit.
- kendex runs the installer through the `repo-effects` declaration in `SKILL.md`; every verb that drops the package runs `--uninstall` while the scripts are still on disk; `kendex guard install`, `guard uninstall` and `guard check` call it directly; `kendex check` relays `--check` only where `.git/hooks/kendex-guards` exists.

## The pre-commit chain

`scripts/pre-commit` judges one commit snapshot: staged content, with tracked configuration read from the index. Order:

1. `doc-limits --staged` for document byte ceilings, from the committing work tree's copy first, then this install's; a stated skip where neither exists or the repo-local one rejects `--staged` in its first-line parser diagnostic.
2. `preflight --staged`, resolved the same way; a first commit skips it with a note.
3. `bot-instructions check --staged`, resolved the same way, so no consumer carries a wrapper for it.
4. `commit-guards all --staged`.
5. The repo-root-relative executable `COMMIT_GUARDS_PRE_COMMIT_LOCAL` names, when set.

Every step runs before the verdict; any other companion failure blocks. The shims fail closed on `2` for a guard that could not run, naming what is missing.

## The markdown lanes

- `md-blocks.awk` mode `check` prints md-format's violations, `reflow` the file in the format, `lines` the judged lines with blockquote prefix stripped, the HTML block lines apart, and each heading's text.
- md-refs runs the `lines` stream through `md-refs.awk`, then resolves in three passes: every selected file's references, the headings of every cited file read from the index whether or not in scope, then the verdict. Its source set joins the first pass through `md-refs.awk -v grammar=text`, fed by `comment-text.sh`; one `git grep` for the section sign over the index names the files that pass opens, so a source tree with no citation costs one search.
- Both programs are POSIX awk (no interval expressions, no gawk builtins) under `LC_ALL=C`; `mawk` and `gawk --posix` give the same records over the suites' fixtures.
- The reflow is the check's state machine printing instead of complaining, so a reflowed file passes md-format by construction; `tests/md-reflow.test.sh` proves it over the corpus and proves each rewrite is a fixed point.
- The batch passes `--staged` to both markdown checks. md-format selects changed documents; md-refs checks all configured documents against the index. `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_SCOPE=all` makes unflagged checks unconditional.

## todo-ban marker shapes

Stated once, in CHECKS.md § todo-ban. At `--staged` the change set is collected as byte-ceiling's staged lane collects it (`--raw`, renames at exact content, symlinks and gitlinks dropped by destination mode), a `git grep --cached` over those paths names the carriers in chunks inside ARG_MAX, and only the named paths reach the per-path `-U0` diff. Membership is a `case` over a newline-delimited set: Bash 3.2 has no associative array.

## byte-ceiling sizing

Sizes are `git cat-file -s` of the diff's source and destination blobs. The source size is the tighten-only baseline when it already exceeds the ceiling. Rename detection is pinned on and held to exact content in the staged and base lanes.

## suppression-ban patterns

The pathspec table is in CHECKS.md § suppression-ban. The bare-allow count runs over `gg_content_carriers`, then one `git grep --cached -c` per surviving `*.rs` carrier; a count that never arrived is a collection error, never 0. A tracked `*.rs` path holding a tab or newline is a config error.

## Settings sources

`scripts/lib/settings.sh` resolves each key environment > `.env.local` > `.kendex/settings.toml` > committed `kendex.settings.toml` (flat `KEY = "value"` under `[env]`) > default; `.env` is never read. Env files take `KEY=value` or `export KEY=value`, parsed, never sourced. Only an absent source is skipped; one that exists but is unusable (unreadable, a directory, FIFO, socket or device, a dangling symlink) is exit 2. `COMMIT_GUARDS_SETTINGS_FILE=/dev/null` selects no file source. Scripts `cd` to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` first, so every relative path is repo-root-relative; a per-check flag overrides every source.

## Excludes format

The row format, the `!` carve and the `\!` escape are stated in `SKILL.md § Configuration`; all six excludes lists share it, and a bare `!` is a config error. A baseline is `path<TAB>count`, `LC_ALL=C` sorted, unique paths, positive counts; a malformed, unsorted or duplicated row is exit 2, never repaired. The path-glob lists (`COMMIT_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_PATHS`, `COMMIT_GUARDS_PROSE_PATHS`, `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_PATHS`, `COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_REFS_PATHS`, `COMMIT_GUARDS_COMMENT_PATHS`) load through `gg_load_path_globs`: an absolute pattern, one escaping the repository, one leading with `-`, and an empty list are exit 2. The caller runs under `set -f`, which the loader checks; without it the patterns expand against the work tree.

## Probing a terminal-only code path

A headless suite cannot reach a branch that exists only at a tty (`mv` prompts before replacing a write-denied destination only there). `gg_pty_run CAP SCRIPT_FILE` in `tests/lib/pty.bash` runs a bash script with fds 0, 1 and 2 on a pseudo-terminal, picking the `script` grammar from `uname`; a host whose `script` answers neither form is a red naming the spawner, not a skip. Its states are enumerated above the function and nowhere else. `tests/terminal-paths.test.sh` is the worked example; its `pty_line` runs one session body and `install_line` is the wrapper an install case copies.

- Stdin is `/dev/null`, so a prompt is answered by EOF.
- A time cap on both sides: after `CAP` seconds the caller kills the session's process group, then the spawner's; the session holds the same deadline over itself a few seconds later.
- Assert the effect the branch has, not the spawner's status; `GG_PTY_STATE = ok` is the separate claim that the probe ran.
- Pair every negative with positive evidence the code was entered: echo a marker before the call and require it back.
- Check the premise inside the session: mode `0444` is not enforced at euid 0.
- Every path written into the session goes through `%q`; the session exports `LC_ALL=C`.

## Commit change collection

`scripts/lib/commit-changes.sh::gg_commit_changes` owns the changed, written and product path sets. The changelog message gate and kendex's compile scheduling share these sets. Product paths use `COMMIT_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_REQUIRED_PATHS`. Rename sources and destinations both count as changed paths. The written set retains the changelog gate's content and file-mode rules.
