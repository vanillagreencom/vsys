# git tells a commit-msg hook the message and nothing else: no flag, no
# variable, no file saying HEAD is about to be REPLACED rather than followed.
# So the answer lives in one place, the argv of the `git commit` this hook
# descends from, read under two conditions, because the wrong answer is the
# dangerous one — a commit judged against a parent it does not have is excused
# by an entry belonging to a commit it is not amending. GIT_INDEX_FILE must be
# set, since git sets it for the hooks it runs a commit through and its absence
# means a DIRECT run — a person, a test, a script — whose ancestors say nothing
# about what it judges. And the argv must come from the NEAREST git ancestor,
# the command doing the committing; the walk stops there rather than reading a
# `git rebase` further up, answering for something else. Anything unreadable is
# not an amend — a process already gone, eight generations carrying no git, or
# no `/proc` at all, which is every macOS host — which is the judgement this
# lane made before: HEAD, and a refusal the writer clears by staging the
# fragment. `ps` would reach macOS and is deliberately not the fallback,
# because it joins argv with spaces and a message merely CONTAINING `--amend`
# would excuse a commit.
