# ${#var} follows the ambient locale, and a git hook inherits whatever
# environment the committer has, so the same text would be accepted in one
# shell and refused in another.
#
# Each well-formed UTF-8 sequence collapses to one character; every other byte
# counts as itself. So a stray continuation byte, an overlong form, a
# surrogate encoding and an out-of-range lead byte each cost one per byte
# rather than one per sequence: text that is not valid UTF-8 has no character
# count, and a cap must round that in the direction that cannot let an
# over-long value through. The alternatives are the byte grammar RFC 3629
# defines — the same ranges GG_ENTRY_AWK validates against — because a range
# written loosely is what makes E0 80 80 or F4 90 80 80 measure as one.
