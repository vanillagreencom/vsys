# atomic-install.sh — how this family REPLACES a file it owns: a policy
# baseline, a collated changelog record, or reflowed markdown. One helper does the write, and the
# two it leans on are what it needs to do that safely — the destination's
# mode, and what a failing step said.
#
# The rule the whole file exists for: a destination is replaced whole or not
# at all. A truncated policy file reads as a complete one, and for a ratchet
# baseline that LOOSENS the gate instead of failing it, so every write goes
# through a staging file in the destination's own directory and a rename.
#
# GG_INSTALL_TMP — the in-flight staging file — is declared and removed in
# lib/common.sh, not here, and that is deliberate rather than inherited. The
# declaration resets any value the environment handed this process, and it
# has to run in EVERY guard, including the ones that never source this file;
# the removal has to be gg_cleanup, because a process arms one EXIT trap and
# that is it. So this file's half of the contract is narrow: gg_install_file
# sets the variable when it stages and clears it when the rename consumes the
# file, and nothing here ever deletes it.
#
# Needs lib/common.sh sourced first — for gg_cleanup, gg_shown, gg_scrubbed
# and gg_collection_error — and a caller that has armed gg_tmpdir for the
# scratch the diagnostics are captured into. Sourced, never executed.
