# What the record's `## [Unreleased]` section IS, found by structure. A fenced
# block opens on a run of three or more backticks or tildes (up to three
# leading spaces) and closes only on a run of at least that length in the SAME
# character with nothing but whitespace after it, so a three-backtick line
# inside a four-backtick block does not end it. Nothing inside a fence is a
# heading; a level-1 or level-2 ATX heading switches the section on or off,
# and every other line inside it is content — the fence lines included, so an
# example counts as much as a bullet. A code span or a fenced
# example naming `## [Unreleased]` therefore moves nothing.
#
# The heading matches on EQUALITY, case-folded, once its leading spaces,
# its hashes and any closing hashes come off. A prefix test would make
# `## [Unreleased] archive` the canonical section, and the collator folds
# fragments into whatever bounds it is handed and then deletes the fragment
# files — entries consumed by a heading nobody meant, and no copy left to
# recover them from. A record with no `## [Unreleased]` heading has no
# section at all, which is what its readers refuse.
#
# The parser emits the pending heading line, section heading lines, and end
# line for collation. A missing section, duplicate section, or unclosed fence
# is a refusal. The collator uses these boundaries without another search.
#
# entry_query=1 is the version check's read instead: one "KIND<TAB>line" row
# per release entry it judges, in file order. KIND is breaking for an item
# opening with a named call-out, and added for an item under the release's
# `### Added` heading, a heading only a level-2 record carries. With
# release_alone=1, a record holding the new version's own section answers
# with that section alone, after a "released<TAB>heading" row: those are the
# entries the release publishes, and pending ones wait for the next release.
# With whole_entry=1 the input is one fragment, whose entry_section names its
# directory. packages_part, GG_PACKAGES_PART, names the part whose entries
# are no release entry of the record's own version.
