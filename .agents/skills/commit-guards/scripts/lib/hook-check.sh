# are folded into the single stdout verdict line, so a caller that sees only
# the summary still learns what is wrong and where. The remedy is the other

# it is as many lines as git gives and stdout stays one line.
# Where a directory sits: which repository owns it, and where it stands

# over the directory it was asked about — every directory would then answer
# with this repository's. The installer asks it too, for the place the
