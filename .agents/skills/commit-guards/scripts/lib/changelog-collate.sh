# shellcheck shell=bash
# changelog-collate.sh — the WRITE half of the changelog lane, run by
# `changelog-entries --collate` and only by the release commit. It folds the
# fragments this same run accepted into the record's `[Unreleased]` section
# and deletes them. One entry is one file, so no two branches ever write the
# same record line; this is the step that turns the files back into sections.
#
# It judges nothing. Which tracked paths are fragments, which section each
# belongs to, whether one is well formed, which file is the collated record
# and where that record's `[Unreleased]` section begins and ends are all
# settled by the walk and the record scope that ran before it — in this
# process, off this run's verdict. That is what closes the split a separate
# collator carried: one grammar, invoked at every commit and here, rather
# than two spellings that can drift, and a second search for the heading is
# what puts entries under a fenced example of it.
#
# The fragments are the ones git carries, because the walk reads the index;
# their content, and the record's, are read from the working tree, so any
# staged, unstaged or non-ignored untracked change stops the write. The caller sets
# COMMIT_GUARDS_CHANGELOG_COLLATE=1 before it changes release files.
#
# Every path moves as NUL-terminated bytes from the walk's records to the
# fold and the delete, so a fragment whose name carries a newline is folded
# in and removed like any other — and every path that reaches a message goes
# through gg_shown on the way.
#
# The record is replaced whole or not at all, through gg_install_file: it
# stages beside the record and renames, keeping the record's own mode and
# carrying the staging file to the exit trap so an interrupt leaves nothing
# behind.
#
# Needs lib/common.sh and lib/changelog-grammar.sh sourced first, and runs on
# the state the walk and the record scope filled in: GG_TMP/frags.z, RECORD,
# RECORD_SHA and the GG_RECORD_* bounds. gg_install_file comes
# from lib/atomic-install.sh, and resolution is at call time, so that one has
# only to be sourced before gg_changelog_collate runs.
#
# Sourced, never executed.

# The heading a section is written under, derived from the section name the
# judge already accepted. Derived rather than tabulated: a second list of
# these names is the drift this lane exists without.
