# shellcheck shell=bash
# The scope the markdown lanes share: which files a run judges, and where it
# reads them. Sourced by md-format, md-refs and md-reflow after lib/common.sh
# and lib/settings.sh; the caller runs under `set -f`, has cd'd to the
# repository root, and calls gg_tmpdir before selecting.
#
# Three scopes, one setting:
#   --staged   every markdown file the staged diff adds, modifies or
#              type-changes, renames held to exact content as byte-ceiling
#              holds them, judged in full from the index
#   --all      every tracked markdown file matching the lane's path globs
#   neither    COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_SCOPE decides: `touched` (the default) is
#              --staged, and with nothing staged the lane judges nothing
#              and says so; `all` is --all
#
# md-refs widens a triggered check to all configured documents so target edits
# recheck unchanged callers.
#
# Both scopes take the lane's path globs and COMMIT_GUARDS_MD_EXCLUDES, the
# family's `pattern<TAB>reason` list with `!` carve-ins. A symlink, a gitlink
# and a binary blob at a selected path are named as unmeasured, never folded
# into a clean count.
