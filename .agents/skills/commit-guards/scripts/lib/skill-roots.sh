# Every project-scope skills directory a kendex install can write, plus the
# source layout kendex itself has.
#
# One definition because it had four, and they disagreed. Each was correct
# when it was written and none was updated together: the installer, the
# helper it bakes into .git/hooks, the pre-commit chain's sibling discovery,
# and a test asserting the shape of a message. A package installed under a
# root only some of them knew was one the others could not find.
#
# The helper cannot source this — it runs from .git/hooks, where the package
# may be gone, which is the whole reason it has a search at all — so the
# installer interpolates this value into the helper it writes. That is one
# definition with one copy taken from it, rather than four originals.
#
# kendex has its own copy in Rust and pins it against the harness adapters
# that write these directories, and against this file.
#
# Sourced, never executed — strict on its own terms rather than its caller's,
# like the other libraries beside it.

# A kendex project can sit below the git top level — a repository holding
# several, each with its own `.agents/skills` — and kendex renders into the
# PROJECT's root. Anchoring the searches at the git top level looked right
# for the common case where the two are the same directory, and found
# nothing in the case where they are not: a sibling gate that failed
# reported nothing and the chain exited 0.
#
# Derived rather than configured: this script is at
# `<project>/<skill root>/commit-guards/scripts`, so two levels up is the
# skill root, and stripping the root off names the project. Nonzero when
# the copy is not under a root this package knows, which is the source
# layout and a caller that should fall back to the git top level.

# What a SKILL.md declares: its frontmatter's `name`, then its `metadata:`

# quotes taken off. Nonzero when the frontmatter or the name is missing, so
# an unreadable package never compares equal to another.
#
# This reads one spelling: `metadata:` then an indented `version: X`. A
# package reads as versionless only when no frontmatter line holds a
# version key in any spelling: at a line's start or after a flow mapping's
# `{` or `,`, quoted or not, with space before its colon or none. A version
# key where this reads no non-empty metadata.version is nonzero, never a
# package that states no version, which the changelog check would let
# change without a raise; a version key outside `metadata:` beside one this
# reads is ignored. The word in a value, `bumps the version`, is no key. A
# YAML comment holds no key: a comment line neither ends the metadata block
# nor counts, and the `metadata:` line may carry one.
