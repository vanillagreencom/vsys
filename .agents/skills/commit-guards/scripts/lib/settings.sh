# Settings resolution for the commit-guards check family. Sourced (not
# executed) by every scripts/* check.
#
# Standalone by design: a consumer that installs only commit-guards has no
# review-gate tree to source its settings loader from. This copy's one
# divergence is the index-scoped resolution the hook lanes need.
#
# Resolution order for every key read through gg_setting (the COMMIT_GUARDS_*
# family):
#   1. explicit environment — a SET variable wins even when set to the empty
#      string, so a caller can force "explicitly empty";
#   2. .env.local (KEY=value, quotes optional — parsed, never sourced);
#   3. .kendex/settings.toml, then the repo's committed kendex.settings.toml
#      (the [env] table's sole `KEY = "value"` assignment; an explicit
#      COMMIT_GUARDS_SETTINGS_FILE consults only itself);
#   4. the built-in default passed by the caller.
# A `.env` file is never read.
#
# COMMIT_GUARDS_SETTINGS_FILE=/dev/null is the force-defaults handle and means
# NO settings source at all: layers 2-3 are skipped whole, leaving explicit
# environment variables and the built-in defaults.
#
# The parser reads the [env] table only, and inside it accepts flat
# single-line basic-string assignments whose value contains no `"` and no
# `\` — exactly the kendex settings contract, decoded identically by every
# kendex resolver. An assignment outside [env] belongs to another tool and
# is ignored; a key re-assigned inside [env], or a value in any other
# shape, fails loud below.
#
# The caller cds to the repo root before resolving, so the default settings
# path is relative.

# Extract the value of one parsed dotenv assignment (text after `KEY=`).
# Quoted values end at the FIRST closing delimiter — dotenv/shell
# semantics; an embedded delimiter would need escaping, which this parser
# does not support — so a quote inside a trailing comment can never leak
# into the value: KEY="500" # say "ceiling" assigns 500. Anything else
# after the closing quote (an adjacent segment like KEY="tools/base".tsv)
# is a shape this parser cannot read and fails NONZERO — truncating it
# would silently load the wrong value. Unquoted values end at the first
# whitespace: KEY=500 # ceiling assigns 500.
