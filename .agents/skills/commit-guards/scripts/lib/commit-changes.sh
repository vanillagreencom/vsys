  # --raw, the spelling todo-ban and byte-ceiling already use: a raw record
  # carries the old and new MODE and the old and new BLOB for every path, so
  # what a commit did to a file is read off the record rather than inferred
  # from a letter. --name-status collapses each record into one letter, which
  # hides a rename from its source, a copy from a rename, and a chmod from a
  # rewrite. Blobs leave nothing to interpret.
  # -c diff.renames=true and --find-renames=100%, the sibling spelling again:
  # detection is PINNED rather than inherited, so `diff.renames=copies`
  # cannot put a record shape on this stream that the loop does not read, and
  # R stays the only status carrying two paths.
  # -z, so a path carrying a newline or a byte git would otherwise quote
  # reaches the globs as the bytes git recorded: a quoted name matches no
  # glob, which is a rule that stops seeing the files it is about. Read back
  # from a FILE rather than a pipe, so the loops set variables in this shell.
  #
  # The base is the parent the commit will HAVE: HEAD ordinarily, HEAD's own
  # parent for an amend, which replaces HEAD rather than following it, so
  # `--cached` alone would show only what was staged on top of a fragment the
  # commit already carries. GG_COMMIT_BASE is empty in the ordinary case,
  # where `--cached` already means HEAD, and unquoted for exactly that reason:
  # one revision or no argument at all, never a path and never a glob.

  # What "written" MEANS, over the record's full identity: a mode and a sha
  # together, never a sha alone. Equal shas are TWO states, and only the modes
  # beside them tell those apart — a chmod leaves both modes regular, while a
  # symlink replaced by a regular file holding the link target's own bytes is
  # one blob under two modes. git emits that second record as
  # `:120000 100644 <sha> <sha> T`, so a sha comparison alone would refuse a
  # commit whose only changelog work was turning a link into a real fragment.

  #   no blob after the commit    no — the path is gone, and deleting a

  #   the blob changed            yes — the ordinary case, an addition
  #                               included, since an addition has no old blob

  # WRITTEN is narrower: gg_record_gained above, plus a rename's destination,
  # which held nothing at that path before and so is written whatever its
  # blob says — which is why a pure rename, whose two blobs are equal, still
  # counts. What the content turned INTO is the changelog-entries lane's
  # judgement, running beside this one.
  #
  # A COPY leaves its source unchanged, so staging it would demand an entry
  # for a file the commit did not touch. Pinning detection above is what
  # keeps C off this stream; the arm below refuses it rather than reading it
  # as a rename, because that pin is the only thing holding.
