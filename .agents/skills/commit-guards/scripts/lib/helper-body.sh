# repository is measured against.
#
# It cannot source anything. A helper runs from .git/hooks with no guarantee
# the package is still installed — the case its own search exists to survive
# — so what it needs is interpolated in or written out.

# `kid'"'"'; exit 0; #` baked a helper that exited 0 before running anything,
# so both hooks passed every commit: the fail-open this package exists to

# checkout-supplied installer, so a project whose own `project_rel` differs
# from the armed one has not been armed and must not be served. Excusing it
# hands project B the consent project A gave. `skill_roots` is the
