# Expected completion state(s) for an issue, keyed by its ROLE in the validation.
#
#   bundle-child  A sub-issue processed under its parent session as part of a
#                 bundle. It is marked Done per-sub-issue while the parent
#                 session aggregates it, so it must be "Done".
#
#   session-root  The managed top-level issue of a worktree session (a single
#                 delegation / decomposition child worked directly). Whether or
#                 not it has a parent, it follows the managed lifecycle and
#                 stays pre-merge until PR merge, so it may be "In Progress"
#                 OR "In Review" at validation time. This is the default role.
#
#   container     A bundle parent whose children are each worked as their own
#                 PR unit; the container itself is never orchestrated and
#                 closes LAST, after its final child. Its own state name is
#                 not checked here (see build_completion_validation_result:
#                 the container role gates on state_type instead), so this
#                 helper emits nothing for it.

#
# The distinguishing "role" is supplied explicitly by the caller (positional
# target => session-root; bundle-expanded child => bundle-child; positional
# target under --container => container); it — not parent_id — drives the
# expected-state decision, so a parented issue run as the managed session root
# is not forced to Done. It is a late, defaulted argument so the first
# four positions stay compatible with the original signature. parent_id is
# retained for call-site provenance and to keep the record shape
# self-describing.
#
# The container role inverts the bundle contract: children complete first,
# each as its own PR unit, and the container closes LAST. Its state check is
# therefore keyed on state_type, not state name — any live state passes, a
# canceled container (or one with no state_type evidence) fails closed — and
# has_summary does not gate `ok`: the summary is posted by `issues complete
# --summary` at completion time, after this validation runs.

# --- Reach guard (create-time filing bar) ---
#
# The reply grammar makes filing the cheap disposition: `Declined:` needs a
# disproof a gate checks, `Tracked: <ID>` needs only an issue to exist, so a
# hypothetical gets an issue where it should have got a decline. Every Linear
# `Tracked:` passes through this create, so it is where the filing bar can be
# held on this tracker; a `Tracked: #<n>` filed with `gh issue create` never
# reaches here and is unguarded. Under LINEAR_REQUIRE_REACH
# (kendex.settings.toml [env]) a create refuses, before any API call, a
# description with no `Reached by:` line — an unsubstituted placeholder and a
# null token counting as absent. Whether the line names a real producer is the
# author's judgement, not this guard's. Empty or unset keeps the guard off.
# The bar itself is project-management SKILL.md, § Disposition.

# The rule the refusal quotes, so message and rule cannot drift apart.
REACH_RULE='An issue names what reaches it: the user action, run, check, or shipped producer that arrives at the defect (an owner-directed item names the ask). An unsubstituted placeholder or a null token is no value at all.'

# "nothing here", name no more than a blank line does. Both resolve to the
