# Date comparisons against cached Linear records.
# Source this file in command scripts that select by startsAt or updatedAt.
#
# sync stores `startsAt` and `updatedAt` exactly as Linear returns them: UTC,
# millisecond precision, a `Z` suffix. Every date filter over the cache compares
# those strings lexically, so a comparison timestamp must carry the same shape.
# `date -Iseconds` does not — it emits the host's local time with an offset
# suffix, which only agrees on a UTC host. Off UTC it moves the cut by the whole
# offset, so within that window either side of a cycle boundary the answer is
# wrong: east of UTC `current` names a cycle that has not started, and west of
# it `current` names the previous cycle, or nothing at all when no earlier cycle
# is incomplete.

# Now, in the shape the cache stores.
