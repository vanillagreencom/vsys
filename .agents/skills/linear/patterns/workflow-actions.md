# Workflow Actions

Multi-step issue/project transitions built from the `linear` skill's commands. Command syntax is in `SKILL.md`.

Every state change that reflects a decision (cancel, absorb, rescope, reparent, reprioritize) gets a comment recording why in the same step.

## State Transitions

```bash
scripts/linear.sh issues activate [ISSUE_ID] --agent [AGENT]
scripts/linear.sh issues block [ISSUE_ID] --by [BLOCKER_ID] --reason "[REASON]"
scripts/linear.sh issues unblock [ISSUE_ID]
scripts/linear.sh issues complete [ISSUE_ID] --summary-file [SUMMARY_PATH]
```

Cancel, duplicate, and absorb are all `comments create` + `issues update --state "Canceled"`; name the surviving issue in the comment on both sides of an absorb.

## Descriptions

Write multiline or markdown bodies to a file and pass `--description-file` / `--body-file`. Inline `--description`/`--body` is for short plain strings only; never use heredocs.

After adding, removing, or reordering children, rebuild the parent's description from its actual `children[]` (read it with `cache issues get [PARENT_ID] --with-bundle`), preserving sections that are still valid.

## Hierarchy and Relations

```bash
scripts/linear.sh issues update [CHILD_ID] --parent [PARENT_ID]
scripts/linear.sh issues update [CHILD_ID] --remove-parent
scripts/linear.sh issues add-relation [ISSUE_ID] --blocks|--blocked-by|--related [OTHER_ID]
scripts/linear.sh issues remove-relation [ISSUE_ID] --blocks|--blocked-by [OTHER_ID]
```

A `make_parent` action carrying `retitle` applies the retitle alongside the reparenting.

Blocking-relation shape: SKILL.md § Blocked Label vs Issue Relations; a rejection states the rule the pair failed.

Never drop a valid dependency. Lift child-level dependencies to the parent level when bundles are involved, and use `--related` when the dependency is informational rather than blocking.

## Labels

`--labels` replaces the entire issue-label set: every update passes the full intended final set, never just the changed label.

Before any create or label update from a workflow:

1. `scripts/linear.sh sync --reconcile` when the cache is missing or stale, then `scripts/linear.sh cache labels list --format=safe`.
2. Build the full final set from the project's taxonomy, rejecting unknown labels, parent/group labels (`is_group: true`), missing required categories, and exclusive-category conflicts.
3. Ask for explicit authorization before creating any missing label; never create labels automatically.

Project labels are a separate resource and must not be used for issue-label preflight.

## Bulk and Cycle Assignment

```bash
scripts/linear.sh issues bulk-update [ID_1] [ID_2] --cycle [CYCLE_ID] --state "Todo"
```

On a nonzero `bulk-update` exit, read its JSON before retrying — `partial: true` means some issues already changed, and `results` identifies which.

When a child's state or cycle changes, fetch the parent and promote it when a child advances into active work — never demote it.

## Projects and Initiatives

```bash
scripts/linear.sh projects update [PROJECT_ID] --state started|completed
scripts/linear.sh projects add-dependency [PROJECT_ID] --blocked-by [OTHER_PROJECT_ID]
scripts/linear.sh projects set-sort-order [PROJECT_ID] --after|--before [OTHER_ID]
scripts/linear.sh initiatives add-project [INITIATIVE_ID] --project [PROJECT_ID]
scripts/linear.sh initiatives update [INITIATIVE_ID] --status Active
```

## Creating Follow-up Issues

```bash
scripts/linear.sh issues create \
  --state "Backlog" \
  --title "[TITLE]" --project "[TARGET_PROJECT]" --labels "[VALIDATED_LABELS]" \
  --priority [PRIORITY] --estimate [ESTIMATE] --description-file [PATH]
```

`[PATH]` holds a body built from project-management's `templates/issue-description-template.md`, including the `Reached by:` line. `[VALIDATED_LABELS]` is the full preflighted label set including the project's required agent/domain/workflow categories, not a bare agent label. Add any blocking relations the new issue should impose after it exists.
