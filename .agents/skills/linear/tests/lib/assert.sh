# installs the EXIT trap that turns those claims into the suite's verdict. A
# suite that reaches its end without executing an assertion fails: an exit code
# reports on the process, not on anything that was checked.
#
# Helpers never return non-zero and never exit. A failed assertion is recorded
# and the suite runs on, so one run reports every failure and no assertion can
# be skipped by an errexit abort. `assert_stop` ends the suite where continuing
# would be meaningless.
#
# Cleanup goes through `assert_tmpdir` and `assert_at_exit`. Installing another
# EXIT trap replaces this one and disarms the verdict.

# --- cache isolation --------------------------------------------------------
#
# The scripts under test resolve their cache and attachment store from the
# repository the process is standing in, which for a suite is the developer's
# own kendex checkout. A suite that creates a comment or completes an issue
# therefore wrote its fixture identifiers into the real .cache/linear, where
# `cache issues list` and any audit can see them.
#
# The redirect is installed here, once, for every suite that sources this file:
# no suite has to remember it, and each suite is isolated before its first line
# runs. LINEAR_CACHE_ROOT outranks the git root in the scripts under test, and
# the scratch root goes with the suite's other scratch directories at exit — on
# success, on a failed assertion, and on an abort alike, taking any lock file
# written under it.
#
# A suite that stands up its own project root re-points LINEAR_CACHE_ROOT at
# that root, which must still be scratch it registered. The verdict refuses
# anything else: a suite that unsets the variable, or aims it at a directory it
# does not own, is a suite writing to the real cache again.
#
# A suite whose subject IS the root resolution cannot do that — the redirect
# outranks the git root, so pointing it anywhere answers the question under
# test. Such a suite keeps this default and drops the variable per invocation
# with `env -u LINEAR_CACHE_ROOT`, standing in scratch of its own so nothing
# reaches the real cache. cache-root-git-worktree.test.sh is the example.
