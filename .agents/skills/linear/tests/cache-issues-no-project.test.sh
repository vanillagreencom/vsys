# cache issues list --no-project.
#
# `cache issues list --no-project` must be implemented by the argument loop
# silently swallowed any unknown flag, so the requested "only unassigned" filter
# never ran and the command returned every issue up to the limit — project-
# assigned rows included. Consumers reading it as unassigned triage debt (TPM
# audits, audit-issues) inflated their worklists with false positives.
#
# The rows themselves were never wrong: each carries the same .project.name that
# `cache issues get` reports, from the same issues.json. The bug was purely the
# missing filter plus the silent-swallow. This locks in:
#   A. --no-project returns ONLY issues with no project, and each returned row's
#      own project field is empty — the list cannot disagree with a get record.
#   B. --no-project is mutually exclusive with --project / --all-projects.
#   C. An unknown/unimplemented filter flag fails loudly instead of degenerating
#      to a full unfiltered listing.
#   D. --help and an ordinary list are unaffected.
#
# Fully offline — pure cache read, no curl needed.
