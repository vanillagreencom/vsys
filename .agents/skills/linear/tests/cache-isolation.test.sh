# Verifies a test suite could not point the scripts at a
# cache of its own, so every suite that created a comment or completed an issue
# wrote its fixture identifiers into the developer's real .cache/linear.
# Entering a throwaway repo was the only isolation that worked, and PROJECT_ROOT
# cannot substitute for one — common.sh assigns it from `git rev-parse` on every
# source, so a caller's value never survives. LINEAR_CACHE_ROOT is the redirect,
# read before anything derived from where the process is standing.
#
# Locks in:
#   A. LINEAR_CACHE_ROOT outranks the repository the process is standing in;
#   B. with it unset the git root still decides, so the redirect adds a channel
#      rather than replacing one;
#   C. a value naming no directory is refused, not quietly ignored — falling
#      back would put the caller's fixtures in the real cache, the exact
#      failure the redirect exists to prevent;
#   D. a comment write leaves no lock file beside the issue it wrote, so a
#      cache stops accruing one permanent .lock per issue ever commented on;
#   E. lib/assert.sh redirects every suite that sources it, and its verdict
#      refuses a suite that ends with the redirect pointing anywhere else.
