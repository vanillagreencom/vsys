# Runs every suite's must-fail control.
#
# A control breaks the one behaviour its suite claims to cover, in a copy of
# the skill, and the suite must go red naming the assertion that covers it. A
# suite with no control is a failure here: an untested control is an untested
# suite. So is a control no suite owns: nothing runs it, so the mutation it
# describes is never applied and the behaviour it claims to prove is unproven.
#
# Every mutation a control declares is staged and run on its own copy, and it
# names the assertion it must redden, whole: the name is matched against one
# line of the suite's output, not searched for inside it, so a control naming
# a prefix of an assertion is naming an assertion the suite does not have.
# Every declared assertion belongs to
# exactly one mutation, and that mutation's own run must redden it. A mutation
# applied alongside others reports as proof of whatever they broke; one that
# reddened on a harness verdict rather than on the assertion it named proves
# nothing at all; and one with no assertion left to claim, because every one it
# reddens is already another mutation's, has nothing to say for itself. One
# rule refuses all three.
#
# What it does not refuse is a mutation whose failures happen to sit inside
# another's under an assertion nobody else claims. Refusing that would take
# legitimate evidence with it: in controls/mutation-isolation.control.sh
# mutation 5's failures sit wholly inside mutation 8's, and mutation 5 is the
# only thing that reddens the TIMEOUT case.
