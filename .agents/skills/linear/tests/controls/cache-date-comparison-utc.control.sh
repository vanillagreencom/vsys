# Each mutation runs alone on its own copy and names the assertions it owns.
# Several of these assertions redden under more than one mutation, since the
# date helpers sit behind one another; the owner is the mutation the assertion
# answers for, and no assertion is declared twice. Ownership was assigned by
# running each mutation on its own and reading what it reddened, not from what
# a mutation is expected to reach.

# 1. The comparison timestamp goes back to local time with an offset suffix.
