# One mutation per behaviour the suite claims, each on its own copy. Arms 1
# and 8 remove the issues and labels team stages outright, so arm 9 names the
# cycles read for the unfiltered listing; arms 11 and 12 narrow the issues and
# labels reads when no team is asked for, which is what their unfiltered rows
# refuse.

# 1. Neutralize the team stage `cache issues list --team` composes into its
#    filter. The flag is still bound and still exits 0, so every team's issues
#    come back — the symptom the deleted consume-and-ignore arm produced.
control_expect "A: --team KEN returns exactly KEN issues"

    '    jq_filter="$jq_filter$(cache_team_stage "$team")"' \
    '    : # control: the flag is bound and the cache goes through unfiltered'

# 2. Restore consume-and-ignore on the issues arm, the shape the deleted
#    `--team | --assignee | --created-since) shift 2` arm had: a filter the
#    cache does not implement is swallowed and the full listing comes back.
control_expect "B: --assignee is refused, named as itself on the issues command"
control_expect "B: --created-since is refused, named as itself on the issues command"

    '        -*) cache_unknown_flag "issues list" "issue" "$1"; return 1 ;;' \
    '        -*) shift; continue ;; # control: the flag is consumed and ignored'

# 3. Restore `*) shift ;;` on the labels arm, so the inline `--team=X` spelling
#    is swallowed and every team's labels come back at rc 0.
control_expect "C: labels --team=KEN is refused, named as itself on the labels command"
control_replace scripts/commands/cache-query.sh 1 \
    '        -*) cache_unknown_flag "labels list" "label" "$1"; return 1 ;;' \
    '        -*) shift; continue ;; # control: the flag is consumed and ignored'

# 4. Restore `*) shift ;;` on the cycles arm, so an unknown flag is swallowed
#    and every cycle comes back at rc 0.
control_expect "D: cycles --bogus is refused, named as itself on the cycles command"
control_replace scripts/commands/cache-query.sh 1 \

    '        -*) shift; continue ;; # control: the flag is consumed and ignored'

# 5. Accept a given-but-empty team, so `--team ""` degrades to the whole
#    workspace at rc 0 on all three listings. The guard above it survives, so
#    the G assertions still answer in the JSON shape and this claims none of
#    them.
control_expect "F: --team with an empty value refuses instead of returning every team"
control_expect "F: labels --team with an empty value refuses too"
control_expect "F: cycles --team with an empty value refuses too"

control_replace scripts/commands/cache-query.sh 1 \
    '    [[ -n "$2" ]] && return 0' \
    '    return 0 # control: a given-but-empty team is not refused'

# 6. Drop the missing-value guard, so a valueless `--team` dies on set -u with a
#    bash unbound-variable message instead of the file's JSON error object. The
#    empty-value refusal below reads $2 too, so this reddens the shape on every
#    listing at once.

# 7. Resolve the cycle keyword against every team's cycles again, so
#    `--team KEN --cycle current` picks OTHER's cycle and prints nothing.

# 8. Drop the team stage from the labels read, so the space form filters
#    nothing while the inline form still refuses.

# 9. Drop the empty-team guard in cache_team_stage, so a request naming no team
#    composes `select(.team.name == "")` and matches nothing. Arms 1 and 8 have
#    already removed the issues and labels stages, so the cycles read is where
#    this still shows.

# 10. Bind a flag standing where the value should be, so `--team --max` takes
#     --max as the team name, swallows the real flag, and answers [] at rc 0.
control_expect "G: --team followed by another flag is a missing value, not a team named --max"
control_replace scripts/commands/cache-query.sh 1 \
    '    -*)' \

#     listing loses OTHER's issue while every filtered row still answers.

# 12. The same for the labels read.
