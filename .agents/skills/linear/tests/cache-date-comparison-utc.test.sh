# Cache date comparisons are UTC, and cycle selection anchors on a date.
#
# sync stores `startsAt` and `updatedAt` as Linear returns them — UTC, a `Z`
# suffix — and every filter over the cache compares those strings lexically. The
# comparison timestamp was built with `date -Iseconds`, which emits the host's
# local time with an offset suffix, so the two were only comparable on a UTC
# host. Off UTC the cut moved by the whole offset, so within that window either
# side of a cycle boundary `current` named a cycle that had not started (east of
# UTC) or the previous one, or nothing at all where no earlier cycle was
# incomplete (west of it).
#
# So TZ is PINNED here, not read from the host. The assertions state the UTC
# answer, which is the only right one at any TZ.
#
# The same helpers carry the second defect: with no cycle running, prev/next and
# past/upcoming fell back to a POSITION in the date-sorted list rather than to a
# date, which inverted both answers — a cycle that has not started was reported
# as the previous one, to the read cycle planning consumes. The second fixture
# carries two cycles on each side of now, because a helper returning them in the
# wrong order reads as green off a one-element list.
#
# Fully offline — pure cache reads, no curl needed.
