# Linear keeps a canceled project under the name a live one reuses.
# cache_get_project selected with `.[] | select(.id == $ref or .name == $ref)`
# and printed every match, so a duplicated name emitted two concatenated
# top-level JSON objects at rc 0 — in --format=safe and --format=raw alike —
# and `cache projects get "<name>" | jq -r '.id'` read two ids. The cache
# command must prefer the live project when the name also matches a canceled one.
#
# This locks in the cache spelling of the rule ../SKILL.md § Option Behavior
# states for a name that selects one project:
#   A. A name matching a live project and its canceled twin returns exactly one
#      object, the live one, in both formats — so `| jq -r '.id'` reads one id.
#   B. A UUID reaches the canceled project directly, whatever its state.
#   C. A name whose every match is canceled is refused, naming each UUID and
#      state, rather than answering with a canceled project.
#
# Fully offline — pure cache read, no curl needed.
