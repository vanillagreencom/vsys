# Doc-contract test for the completed-blocker relation rule.
# SKILL.md's "Blocked Label vs Issue Relations" section states that a blocking
# relation pointing at a Done/Canceled issue is satisfied history, that the
# relation stays for provenance, that audits must never classify it as stale
# metadata or remove it, and that the only legitimate audit output is a
# scheduling signal. What this test pins is the two ANCHORS in that section:
# the bolded term the rule defines and the quoted signal string it names.
