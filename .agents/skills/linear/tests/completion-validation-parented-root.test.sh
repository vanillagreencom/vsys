# Tests for completion validation of parented session roots.
#
# completion_expected_state() must not return "Done" for every issue with a parent,
# so a decomposition child run as the managed top-level session (kept In Review
# until PR merge per orch's start-worktree workflow, step 5.3) failed validate-completion's
# state_ok gate. The lib now keys the expected state on an explicit call-site
# "role":
#   - bundle-child : a sub-issue processed under its parent session -> expects Done.
#   - session-root : the managed top-level issue (parented or not) -> expects a
#                    pre-merge managed state (In Progress OR In Review).
#
# This exercises the pure function lib directly (no network). The unguarded lib
# fails the case-2 assertions below (a parented session root in In Review/In
# Progress yielded state_ok=false).
