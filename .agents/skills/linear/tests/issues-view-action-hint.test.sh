# Tests for the unsupported `view` action hint.
#
# A focused Linear issue audit's read-only post-mutation verification produced
# `linear.sh issues view` — an action the issues namespace does not have; the
# supported lookups are `issues get`, `issues bulk-get`, and `cache issues
# get` — but the generic unknown-action error gave no pointer to them. The
# issues dispatcher now catches `view` (and the `show` near-miss) with a
# targeted error naming the supported lookups, and the cache issues namespace
# does the same, so an agent that receives stale guidance self-corrects in one
# step. These tests assert those hints, that other unknown actions keep the
# generic error, and that real commands still route.
# Hermetic: curl is stubbed on PATH to fail loudly — no network.
