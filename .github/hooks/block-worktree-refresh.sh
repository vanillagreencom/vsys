# description: Refuse a `kendex` command that writes the project scope (`refresh`, `apply`, `add`, `remove`, `update-pi`, `updates --apply`, `pin`, `fork`, `adopt`, `drift-hook`, `source add|remove|enable|disable`, `marketplace subscribe|unsubscribe`) when the working directory is a linked git worktree and the command does not name the global scope, and whenever a `cd` or `pushd` stands before the verb in the same command, since the directory the write lands in cannot then be read from the command. A project's kendex install is registered to the main checkout, so a project-scope write from a linked worktree renders into that checkout and removes what it does not expect there. Names the two forms that are right: the same command from the main checkout, or the verb's global form (`--global` for add, `--scope global` for update-pi, either for the rest).
# safety: Reads the command text and asks git whether the working directory's git dir differs from its common dir, which is what makes a worktree linked; writes nothing. A git that cannot answer refuses. The verb is read as a word after a `kendex` word, wherever in the command it stands, so a command that merely spells the pair in prose is refused, and that is the accepted cost; the bare `kendex <source>` shorthand for add is not read, since matching it would match every read too. `kendex verify`, `check`, `list`, `report` and every other verb pass; a command carrying `-g`, `--global` or `--scope global` in the verb's own segment, with no `--scope project` or `--scope all` beside it, passes because it names the scope this hook does not guard. A payload that cannot be read, an empty one included, is refused, never skipped.

# The verb as a word after a `kendex` word, judged one segment at a time: a
# segment is the text between two of `;`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)` and a line end,
# with a backslash-newline continuing it, and it ends at a `#` that begins a
# word, since the shell drops the comment behind it. The global scope is not
# this hook's, and `-g`, `--global` or `--scope global` exempts a write only
# when it stands in the verb's own segment and no `--scope project` or
# `--scope all` stands there too, because kendex gives `--scope` precedence
# over `--global`; read across the whole command the word would let
# `kendex refresh -g && kendex refresh` through on the first command's word.
# `kendex updates` is a write only with `--apply`, which delegates to refresh.
# The bare `kendex <source>` shorthand for add is not read: matching it means
# matching every `kendex <word>`, reads included, and that is the whole CLI.
