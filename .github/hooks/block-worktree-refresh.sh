# description: Refuse a `kendex` command that writes the project scope (`refresh`, `apply`, `add`, `remove`, `update-pi`, `updates --apply`, `pin`, `fork`, `adopt`, `drift-hook`, `source add|remove|enable|disable`, `marketplace subscribe|unsubscribe`) when the working directory is a linked git worktree, the command does not name the global scope, and the project the write lands in is not the worktree's own; and whenever a `cd`, `pushd`, `env -C` or `sudo -D` stands before the verb in the same command, since the directory the write lands in cannot then be read from the command. The project a bare verb writes is the one kendex resolves from the working directory; where that project has no manifest of its own in the linked worktree (kendex.toml, or kendex-local.toml for a source catalog), its declarations are the main checkout's, so a project-scope write renders into that checkout and removes what it does not expect there. Where it has one, it is a project in its own right and its target is unambiguous, so every writing verb but `update-pi` passes there bare. `refresh`, `apply` and `updates --apply` pass in any worktree once they name their target with `--project-path PATH`: the directory the write lands in is then the command's own word; `update-pi` is refused in every worktree at the project scope. Names the forms that are right: `--project-path PATH` where the verb takes it and the installed kendex lists the flag, the same command from the main checkout, or the verb's global form (`--global` for add, `--scope global` for update-pi, either for the rest, the `source` subcommands included). An installed kendex whose `refresh --help` does not list `--project-path` is named with its version instead of the flag it lacks.
# summary: Stops a kendex command that writes a project from inside a linked git worktree, where the write would land somewhere the command does not name.
# safety: Reads the command text and asks git whether the tool call's working directory has a git dir that differs from its common dir, which is what makes a worktree linked, and for a linked worktree its root; walks up from the working directory to that root for the project kendex would write, and tests whether its manifest exists, reading its kendex.toml only for the text `is_source_catalog`; the hook itself writes nothing. A git that cannot answer refuses. The verb is the first word naming one after a `kendex` word, anywhere in the command except the text the shell would not run: the words inside a quoted span, a heredoc body its command reads as data, and a comment are masked out before the command is read, so prose spelling the pair is not refused, while a span or a heredoc body that a shell, `eval`, `source` or `.` word runs is read as the command it is; a quote that cannot be paired leaves the whole text to be read, so a command this hook could not take apart is refused rather than passed. The command is read by the commit-guards skill's command-position library, found in the install beside the hook; without it every call is refused. The bare `kendex <source>` shorthand for add is not read, since matching it would match every read too. `kendex help VERB`, a matched verb with `--help`, `-h` or `--plan` among the words Bash passes it, `kendex updates` without `--apply`, `kendex verify`, `list`, `report`, `check` — whose one write, the scope's install record for copies it proves against their source, renders nothing into any checkout — and every other verb pass. `-g`/`--global`, `--scope`, `--project-path`, `--apply`, `--help`, `-h` and `--plan` are read from the words Bash passes kendex after the verb in its own segment, and for a `source` subcommand also from the option words between `source` and it, where its parser takes them too: a redirection operator and the file it opens are not arguments, a standalone `--` ends the options, and a word there the shell settles only when it runs (a parameter expansion, a glob, a brace, or a backslash) grants no exemption and counts as `--apply`; a command substitution, and a quoted span the command reader opens as command text with the words after it, are cut out of the segment and not read, so a segment the command's text does not follow with a separator, a comment or its end names no global scope and counts as `--apply`. update-pi's `--check` is read from the segment's text. A command carrying `-g`, `--global` or `--scope global` there, with no other `--scope` beside it, passes because it names the scope this hook does not guard, and a `refresh`, `apply` or `updates` carrying `--project-path` there passes because it names the project it writes, the value itself being read by kendex, which refuses the flag without one. On the refusal path only, and only where the refusal of `refresh`, `apply` or `updates --apply` would offer `--project-path`, the hook runs `kendex refresh --help` and `kendex --version` once from the PATH it was given, reads whether the help lists the flag, and captures what both wrote; a kendex that is not on PATH or whose help cannot be read is named as unasked, and the flag is not offered. That kendex is a binary of its own: its first run on a machine records the command's path under kendex's data directory, and it writes into no checkout. A payload that cannot be read, an empty one included, is refused, never skipped. Every refusal opens with `block-worktree-refresh: <key>=<value>`; what a command this hook runs writes is captured at the site and replayed under that line, so nothing precedes the key.

# The four options this hook decides on — `-g`/`--global`, `--scope`,

# segment as Bash passes them rather than from its text. A redirection
# operator and the file it opens are the shell's, never an argument, whether
# the file is glued to the operator (`>--global`), quoted (`> "--global"`) or
# its own word, and a real option stays one on either side of a redirection.
# A standalone `--` ends the options, so no word after it is one. Each word
# is read in order, because the one before it decides whether it is the
# value of `--scope` or `--project-path`.
#
# A word in the segment whose value the shell settles only when it runs — a
# parameter expansion, a glob, a brace, or a backslash, which can also join
# it to the next word — may be any word at all, `--` and `--scope=project`
# included, so it grants nothing, and so does a segment the reader may have
# cut short: the scope is then the project scope,
# `--apply` counts as present, and a `--project-path` after it is not read as
# a target, since the word before could have ended the options. A quote is
# removed as the shell removes it. Words the command reader cut out of the
# segment are not read at all: a command substitution, and a quoted span it
# opens as command text together with every word after it.
#
# ARG_SCOPE is `unnamed`, `global` or `project`: kendex gives `--scope`
# precedence over `-g` and `--global`, so a `--scope` whose value is not the
# plain word `global` is the project scope whatever stands beside it.
# ARG_TARGET and ARG_APPLY are 1 where a real `--project-path` or `--apply`
# reaches kendex. The value `--project-path` names is not read: kendex
# refuses the flag without one. ARG_READ is 1 where a real `--help`, `-h`
# or `--plan` reaches kendex, on which it prints and writes nothing; an
# unsure word anywhere in the segment withdraws it, since that word may be

# Whose project a bare verb typed here writes, asked as kendex asks it. The
# project is the first directory up from the physical working directory
# that `crates/core/src/discover.rs::project_root_from` takes for a root: one
# holding one of that file's markers, listed here in the same spelling. Its
# refusal of the home directory is not repeated, since a walk bounded by a
# worktree's root does not reach the home directory from below it. The walk
# stops at the linked worktree's root, since a project above it is not the
# worktree's own. The file that declares the project follows kendex's rule,
# `crates/core/src/manifest/file.rs::project_manifest_path`: kendex-local.toml
# for a source catalog, kendex.toml otherwise. This hook does not parse TOML,
# so any readable kendex.toml whose text names `is_source_catalog` counts as
# a catalog: every file kendex reads as one is among them, and a file this
# misreads is refused, never passed. Where that file exists in the worktree
# the project is the worktree's own, and the verbs that write one project by
# being typed inside it write that one. The file is not otherwise read: one
# that will not parse is still this project's, and kendex reports it before
# it writes. Where it does not exist, or no project is found inside the
# worktree, the declarations are the main checkout's, which the refusal
# points at. The main checkout is not derived from the common dir, which a
# repository made with --separate-git-dir keeps outside its checkout;
# `git worktree list` names the checkout first.
