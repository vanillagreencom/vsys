# description: Refuse a command that kills processes by name or by argv pattern (`pkill`, `killall`), whatever flags follow. On a machine where several agents share one checkout and its worktrees, a pattern that matches a tool's name matches every lane running that tool, the caller's own shell included when its command line holds the pattern. Names the accepted forms: `kill <pid>` on a PID the caller recorded when it launched the process, or one whose `/proc/<pid>/cwd` the caller has read and found inside its own worktree.
# summary: Stops a command that kills processes by name. On a machine running several agents, one name matches every lane using that tool. Names the safe form: kill a process id you started.
# safety: One regex over the raw command decides: a `pkill` or `killall` word between two word edges, wherever in the command it stands, a path prefix, a quote or a substitution around it included. Reading the word wherever it stands refuses a harmless command that merely spells it, an echo or a heredoc line included, and that is the accepted cost: it fails closed, so it stalls one command rather than ending another lane's run. A word is seen only where the command already spells it: a spelling the shell assembles from quotes or escapes (`p\kill`, `p'kill'`) is not seen here and reaches the shell, the frozen lexical-scanner class every guard in this directory declares. `kill`, `pgrep` and `ps` are not read, so the same hazard spelled as `kill $(pgrep -f …)` or `pgrep -f … | xargs kill` passes; the rule is the two verbs, and the remedy text is what asks for a PID. A payload that cannot be read, an empty one included, is refused, never skipped. Every refusal opens with `block-argv-kill: <key>=<value>`; what a command this hook runs writes is captured at the site and replayed under that line, so nothing precedes the key.
