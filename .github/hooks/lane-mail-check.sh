# description: Blocks a lane's turn end while its overseer mailbox holds unread lines, so a directive or a ruling reaches the lane without a keystroke, a pane or a question tool. The lane is the work item `LANE_MAIL_ITEM` names, or the one directory under `<repo>/tmp/lane-mail/` whose name lowercases to the current branch; a session with neither is not a lane; a lane whose mailbox holds no unread line passes silently, as does a directory git reports no repository for and that holds no mailbox of its own. The checkout's overseer mailbox, `<repo>/tmp/lane-mail/overseer`, has one reader: the session whose tmux server and pane the checkout's oversee workflow state names under `.overseer`, the pair every writer the orch `schemas/workflow-state.md` `overseer` row names writes, `oversee register` among them for a session opened by hand, and the one the fleet's OVERSEER is established by below, so a record naming a dead pane names no reader. The pair names a session only on the tmux server started at the record's `server_start`, so a server a tmux restart handed the recorded pid and pane id names no reader either; a record carrying no start at all names the session in that pane, which writes its server's start into it. Where a file stands there, that session is handed the notes `lane-mail peer send --repo` wrote there at its turn end and after its tool calls, under the same `unread=<count>` line, unless a live watch holds the fleet state: the `oversee-watch.pid` record a repeat `oversee-watch` writes beside the fleet state on every surface and removes on exit, judged by the orch `lib/watch-pid.sh` library's `watch_pid_live`, which reads the mailbox itself, so the named session is handed nothing from it beside that watch. A fleet watched in single passes writes no watch record, so its named overseer is handed the notes as `unread=` lines and the next pass does not report them. Every other session in the checkout, one the owner opened there for other work included, is handed nothing from that mailbox, and so is a session whose install has no reader beside this hook. For the named session, where the install's `workflow-state path oversee` prints no path, or the library cannot be sourced or answers neither way, the hook refuses, opening `lane-mail-check: fleet-state=<path of the failing file>` with that file's own words under it; the halt arm never reads that mailbox, a subagent's turn end is handed nothing from it, and a session in a checkout with no overseer mailbox pays two file tests for the question. `<repo>` is the lane's root, resolved in this order: `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, the directory Claude Code started the session in; else the root the launch marker for `LANE_MAIL_ITEM` binds, where that root exists; else the directory the hook runs in, which on Codex and Pi is the session's start directory and on Claude Code without the variable is the call's own. A Claude Code lane working from the main clone is therefore still judged on its own mailbox. A root its launch marker binds that has no `tmp/lane-mail` directory is refused at a turn end, before any tool call and after the lead's finished one, opening `lane-mail-check: mailbox-missing=<path>` with the marker and the one `mkdir` command that restores the directory, and that command alone passes a tool call. Before a tool call a subagent is refused whatever it runs, and a call whose caller is unknown may run that command; after one a subagent is handed nothing and refused nothing, as with any mail, and its next call meets the refusal. The marker is looked up for the item `LANE_MAIL_ITEM` names or else the branch names, so that check costs one stat in a repository whose common git directory holds no `lane-mail` directory, and one branch read and one marker stat in one that does. A mailbox belongs to a lane only where a launch recorded one: `open-terminal` and `lane-host create` write the lane's root to `lane-mail/<item in lower case>` under the repository's common git directory and create the lane's own `tmp/lane-mail/<item>`, and a mailbox with no marker bound to this root passes silently. Unread lines are peeked through the orch skill's own `lane-mail inbox --peek`, the one reader of the mailbox and its cursor, and acknowledged with `inbox --ack` only once the refusal is written, so a hook killed at its budget leaves them unread and a line acknowledged here is never handed over twice. That reader is resolved from this hook's own install, walking up to the home directory for `skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail` or the shared `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail` beside it, then the home's own shared tree for a harness root relocated out of it; the open repository's `.agents/skills/orch/scripts/lane-mail` is used only where this hook is installed in that repository, and a reader outside that containment is refused rather than run. The refusal opens with `lane-mail-check: unread=<count>` and carries one JSON envelope per line under it, and for the lead, where a halt is among them, the one `lane-mail inbox` command that reads it; the turn then continues with them. Run with the argument `deliver` by the lane-mail-deliver hook after a tool call, it exits 0 with the harness's JSON on stdout, whose `additionalContext` carries the same lines. That run first judges the context mark of the fleet's OVERSEER, below, for a lead's call in tmux in a checkout whose `tmp/lane-mail/overseer` directory stands, so a mark crossed mid-turn is read at the next tool call: the context is read and recorded as the overseer's turn end reads it and judged at `ORCH_HANDOFF_CONTEXT_PCT` by the rule the orch `references/oversee-events.md` § Judgement rules states for the overseer's context mark. On Pi the window is the payload's own `context_window`, which the pi-hooks carrier puts on the PostToolUse payload of every tool call; a Pi payload naming none, the lane mail wake's run or a tool call from an older carrier, takes no reading, writes no record and hands nothing over, so the turn end's reading and judgement stand. A reached mark, or a setting it cannot be judged on, is handed over as that `additionalContext`, opening `lane-mail-check: context=<tokens>` with the succession and the handoff record as the route, at every tool call until that record stands. Every other line that judgement writes, a judgement that could not run, a transcript it could not read or an `orch-env` this install has not got, is handed over the same way once per session and first line, the last told kept in `tmp/lane-mail/overseer/context-told`, written only once the run's output carrying it is written and cleared by a clean reading; only the session the fleet record names, or the overseer the record lost, writes or clears that file. Either opens the same context as any mail the call hands over, above its `unread=` line, and a refusal the mailbox check makes on the same call, above its keyed line, whether that refusal is Copilot's `additionalContext` or stderr at exit 2. The judgement itself refuses no call, and no account is read there. Run with `start` by the lane-mail-start hook at a session start, or with `prompt` by the lane-mail-prompt hook at a prompt, both on Copilot alone, it hands the same lines over the same way and acknowledges them only once that is written, and refuses nothing: every refusal this description names is its keyed line on stderr at exit 0, with nothing on stdout and nothing acknowledged. Run with `halt` by the lane-mail-halt hook before one, it acknowledges nothing and refuses the call while an unread directive sent with `lane-mail send --halt` stands, opening `lane-mail-check: halt=<id>` with the directive and the one `lane-mail inbox` command that reads it, which names the lane's root with `--root` so it reads the same mailbox from any checkout; that command alone passes. Run with `row` and the event by the session-start-row, session-end-row and stop-failure-row hooks, it writes the event row of a session with no lane of its own, only for the pane's top-level harness and, on Copilot, only for a session the caller rule names the lead, through the orch skill's `lib/session-rows.sh`, the file those hooks describe, and refuses nothing: every gap below its payload read is reported and passed; the overseer's own turn end writes a Stop row there through the same library at every turn end, compact, its time, event, harness and session alone, except over a standing StopFailure row, which it lifts and where it keeps the turn's last message. Run with `caller`, it prints `lead`, `subagent` or `unknown` by the agentStop transcript rule, records and judges nothing, and exits 0. On a Pi install a launched lane's lead writes its own turn rows through that library into its mailbox directory, `session-rows.jsonl`: a Stop row at each turn end, carrying the `stopReason` of the turn's last assistant message in the transcript and Pi's `errorMessage` where that reason is `error`, and a PreToolUse row at the first tool call of each turn, after a turn end or on an empty file, written ahead of the mailbox check; oversee-watch and `lanes state` judge a Pi lane idle, working or walled from those rows in place of its pane, and a gap in the write is reported under `lane-rows-skipped` or `lane-rows-unwritten` and passed. The Pi install is the hook directory under `.pi` or `.pi/agent`, or under the user root `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` names; an install naming no harness writes no row, which a launched lane's turn end reports under `harness-unlisted`. Who made a call is answered once for every arm: the lead, a subagent, or unknown. A SubagentStop payload or one carrying a non-empty `agent_id` or `agent_type` is a subagent's on every harness, handed no mail and acknowledging none, and while a halt stands refused without that command. On Copilot, whose payloads name no agent, a preToolUse or postToolUse call, a preCompact and a context reading the usage arm is handed are the lead's where the session id they carry is a lead session this install recorded, the one rule for all four: one empty file per session under `~/.cache/lane-mail/copilot-leads`, written at the session's sessionStart, which Copilot fires for the lead alone, and at each turn end the transcript rule below proves the lead's, and pruned at a start once untouched for 30 days. A custom subagent's call was measured on Copilot CLI 1.0.88 carrying its own session id, which nothing recorded; whether a built-in task-tool subagent's calls carry their own session id or the lead's is a pending live-lane proof, and one whose calls carry the lead's is read as the lead, handed the lead's mail after its calls, which marks it read, and under a halt shown the read that clears it. A call whose session is no recorded lead, a custom subagent's among them, is unknown: the deliver arm hands it nothing and acknowledges nothing, writing `lane-mail-check: session-unrecorded=<id>` to stderr, the compact arm flags nothing and writes the same line at exit 0, the usage arm records nothing and refuses under that key at exit 2, so the lead's turn end hands the lines over and acknowledges them, and the halt arm refuses it without showing that command yet passes the command, because the reader's `--ack` stops short of an unread halt and a lead whose record could not be written would otherwise be refused for good; the lead is shown the command by every notice and refusal that hands it the halt, its turn end's included. A record that cannot be written is reported on stderr under `lane-mail-check: lead-unrecorded=<path>`, or `=none` for a session start naming no session id, and never refused. A Copilot sessionStart or userPromptSubmitted is the lead's, and an agentStop is ruled by its transcript, below; a prompt records no lead, since that a subagent's prompt fires no userPromptSubmitted is unmeasured. `stop_hook_active` true skips the mailbox check whole on the turn-end run. The flag is in the payload, so nothing above the payload read knows a turn was continued, and `arm`, the `missing-tools` refusal for `jq` or `cat`, `payload=unreadable` and `payload=invalid-json` are refused on every turn, the continued one included. Below that read one rule holds and every refusal is on one side of it: a refusal the lane itself can clear is still made, and a refusal it cannot is reported on stderr and passed. The lane clears the two handoff marks, and `script`, `setting`, `setting-range` and both `transcript` refusals, by writing its handoff record, and `mailbox-missing` by running the command it names, so those are refused on a continued turn as on any other. It clears `idle` by sending a lane-mail ask or notice, so `idle` is refused on a turn another stop hook continued, except on Pi, as the idle rule below states. It clears none of `workdir`, `git`, `item`, `marker` or the `missing-tools` refusal for `git`, `tr`, `awk`, `mktemp` or `tail`, so each of those is reported and the turn ends, where a fresh turn refuses it. The halt arm reports and passes that same set at every tool call: a lane whose tool calls are refused can clear nothing, since clearing it takes a tool call, so there only the payload refusals and the mailbox's own, `reader`, `inbox`, `halt` and `mailbox-missing`, are refused, the last two each passing the one command that clears it. The same turn-end run hands the lane off before it runs out, so the handoff never waits on an overseer reading a pane. It reads this session's context use from the `transcript_path` the payload names, through the orch adapter for the harness this hook's install directory names, `.claude/hooks`, `.codex/hooks` or Pi's `kendex/hooks`: the tokens the last response left in context and effective capacity, with Pi reading the payload's own `context_window`. It records that reading as `context.json` in the lane's mailbox directory, where `lanes context` reads it, and refuses the turn end when `lane_context_handoff_due` requires handoff under the shared context rule in orch `references/oversee-events.md`, Judgement rules. It reads the account the credential this session runs on still has through the orch skill's own `lanes pick --lane`, judging a Claude lane on its own model, and refuses at or below `ORCH_HANDOFF_HEADROOM_PCT` (default 3). A Pi session's account is the one its model's provider bills, by the orch `lane_pick_harness` rule on the `<provider>/<model>` its transcript names: a `pi-claude/` model spends the Claude seat `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` names and is judged there on that model, a `github-copilot/` model spends the Copilot pool on Pi's own root, and any other provider, or a reading naming none, is left unjudged under `account=unmeasured`. Either refusal opens `lane-mail-check: context=<tokens>` or `lane-mail-check: headroom=<percent>` and carries one instruction: reach the next safe point, write the record with `workflow-state set <item> handoff`, send a `handoff` notice, and exit. The record is read where `workflow-state --help` § Handoff record says, a launched lane naming the root its launch marker binds as the worktree, and the instruction names the state directory the read found, so a record written as told ends both refusals. The instruction opens with the `workflow-state init <item>` that `set` needs where the item has no state file yet, so it is enough on its own. It repeats at every turn end, `stop_hook_active` included, until the item's workflow state carries a `.handoff` object no relaunch has resumed; only the lane can write that record, so a single refusal it declines to act on would end the session with nothing recorded. That record is judged before every mark, before every read they rest on and before `orch-env` and `lanes` are looked for, so no failure but the record's own writer can hold a lane that has already done what it was asked. `orch-env` or `lanes` missing from this hook's install, a mark setting that is not a whole number in range, and a transcript the payload names and nothing can read are refusals too, each on the lane path alone and each carrying the same instruction. What the marks cannot judge is reported and passed, never refused: a payload naming no transcript leaves the context unread, and so does a transcript whose last usage line is an object carrying none of the field names its adapter reads, which is reported under `usage-unread=<path>` rather than summed to a figure of zero and read as room, a reading below the independent token limit whose capacity the adapter could not name, reported under `window-unread=<model>`, and an install directory naming no harness, reported under `harness-unlisted=<directory>`; a reading that could not be recorded is reported under `context-unrecorded=<path>` and still judged; an account `lanes` keeps no inventory for, one it could not measure and a read that passed this hook's own ceiling each leave the account unjudged under `account=unlisted`, `account=unmeasured` or `account=timeout`, never read as room, so a setup with no usage endpoint still ends its turns; and a lane whose handoff record cannot be judged leaves both marks unjudged under one of four keys, `handoff-skipped=<path>` for a reader or a script this install has not got, or `handoff-skipped=unlocatable` where this hook's own directory could not be resolved and none of them could be looked for, `handoff-outside=<path>` for one only the open repository supplies, `handoff-unanswered=<path>` for one that is there and answered nothing this hook can read, and `handoff-unreadable=<path>` for a state file the install's own `workflow-state` could not read. Passing the turn is the answer for all four. For the first three it is because an install whose orch scripts cannot answer cannot run `workflow-state set` either, so a lane told to record a handoff with them could never end a turn again; for `handoff-unreadable` the install answers and the fault is the item's own state file, which is the file the record would be written into, so that write could not land either and the refusal would be as uncloseable. A subagent's turn end is judged on neither mark. The fleet's OVERSEER meets four triggers of its own on its turn end: a session with no lane of its own whose tmux server and pane are the pair the oversee workflow state records under `.overseer` is that overseer, and nothing weaker establishes one, so an ordinary session in a fleet checkout is judged on nothing. A session the record does not name whose pane the overseer's `context.json` names, the overseer the record lost, is judged on nothing either, and reports `pane-unrecorded=<its pane key>` with the recorded key under it and writes that record with no reading and the gap `pane-unrecorded`; any other session the record does not name writes nothing, so the real overseer's reading stands. A fleet record naming this session's pane that lacks its server start, its harness or its launch home is healed first, at a turn end and at a tool call alike: the start of this session's own tmux server, the harness this install names and the launch home the harness variable of this session's own environment carries, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME` or `COPILOT_HOME` or that harness's default where it is unset, are written into it through the orch `lib/overseer-launch.sh` `ol_record_heal`, which writes only a fact the record lacks, and the transcript is bound to that home on the same run; a write that fails is reported under `record-unhealed=<pane key>` with the writer's words, and the run still binds to that home. Before it reads that transcript for the overseer it binds it to the current session: the `transcript_path` the payload names is read only where it is this session's own native file, held to the `session_id` the payload carries and the launch home the fleet record names under `.overseer.home`, through the orch adapter for a claude, codex or copilot install; a Pi install states no transcript shape and reads the payload's own window as a Pi lane does. A file that is not this session's under that home, a newer unrelated transcript, a predecessor's in the same pane, or one under an account the fleet never picked, and a binding that cannot be made, a payload naming no session or a record naming no home, are each reported once under `transcript-unowned=<path>` with the reason the gate gave. Nothing is read then, and the context record is written with a null token count and that reason as its `gap` (orch `workflow-state.md`, `context.json` row), so it still advances at every turn end and oversee-watch reports the gap, and the judge is handed this install's harness and no context figure, so it judges the account triggers alone, the `transcript-unowned` line is this hook's one report that the context went unmeasured, and a session is never judged on a file it does not own. Every overseer turn end whose orch context library loads writes that record, a reading or a null token count with a `gap` naming why none was taken: the gate's reason, `binding-missing` for a payload naming no session, `home-unnamed` for a fleet record naming no launch home, `session-mismatch` for a file another session wrote and `home-mismatch` for one under another launch home, `transcript-unnamed` for a payload naming no transcript, `usage-absent` for a transcript holding no usage line, `usage-unread` for a usage object its adapter does not read, which is also reported under `usage-unread=<path>`, `session-record` for a Copilot session with no extension reading whose statusLine session record does not answer either, which is also reported under `session-record=<reason>`, or `pane-unrecorded` below. A Copilot statusLine record reporting allow_all_enabled false, read whether or not an extension reading stands, in a session whose `COPILOT_ALLOW_ALL` is true (a launch line granting `--allow-all` or `--yolo`), is reported under `stop-cause=allow-all-blocked-by-policy`, and the turn end judged as usual. An install naming no harness an adapter reads writes no gap, since its context is never read, and leaves the record as it was, and a Copilot one names none where the reading its usage arm wrote for this session stands, its turn end reading that record rather than taking a reading of its own; a gap record that cannot be written is reported under `context-gap-unrecorded=<path>`, the record keeping its earlier entry. This hook records the overseer's own context reading as `context.json` in the overseer mailbox directory at the main checkout, naming the session and its pane, and hands that reading to `oversee-succeed --check-marks --context <tokens>:<window>` from this hook's own install, which judges those marks on it and on no stored figure, and nothing at the turn end here judges them, under the same ceiling the account read runs under, so the turn-end refusal and the `overseer-mark` watch event cannot describe one overseer differently. Its refusal opens with the `context=`, `headroom=`, `rate=` or `qualifying=` key, carrying the figure that judgement read, and names `oversee-succeed`, handed the same reading, as the route, with `workflow-state set oversee handoff` under it for a succession that refuses, so the refusal always has an escape the overseer can reach. That record names the session that wrote it, in a `session_id` the payload gives and a `pane_key` for a harness that sends none. One other refusal stands on that path, `script` for an `oversee-succeed` this install has not got, and the record clears it as it clears the marks. `ORCH_OVERSEER_SUCCESSION=off`, read off the judgement's own line and never here, turns the account-mark refusals off with the succession they name, the watch's `overseer-mark` event still reporting those marks; the context mark is refused whatever the setting, since no watch event reports it, and the handoff record ends that refusal. An answer this hook cannot act on, one the ceiling abandoned, and one whose own reading was unmeasured are reported under `marks=unjudged`, `marks=timeout` and `marks=unmeasured` and the turn ends, never held. A lane asks its overseer only through lane mail. Before a tool call in a launched lane, the halt arm refuses the harness question tool by its name, whichever of the four names the payload's `tool_name` carries, Claude Code's `AskUserQuestion` and `EnterPlanMode`, Codex's `request_user_input` and Pi's `question`, opening `lane-mail-check: question-tool=<name>` and naming the `lane-mail ask --item <ID> --file <PATH>` send and the `lane-mail wait` on its printed id as the route, because a dialog on the pane reaches no overseer; an unread halt is refused ahead of it, a subagent's call is refused and told to report its question to the lead, and a session that is no launched lane passes the call silently, a committed mailbox and status file included. At a launched lane lead's turn end, once the handoff marks pass, the lane is judged idle on lane-mail facts alone, never on words the lane wrote, on Claude Code, Codex, Pi and Copilot; OpenCode and Cursor run no kendex hooks, and Gemini and Antigravity do not run this one, so a lane there is never judged idle. The reader's own `lane-mail events` listing, which moves no cursor, counts the asks and notices in the lane's outbound file against the count this hook recorded at the lane's last judged turn end, `sent-count` in the lane's mailbox directory: a line holding the count and, where this judge refused that turn end, the word `held`; no record is a count of zero. A count other than the recorded one is a send this turn and passes, a standing handoff record ends the run before this judge, the newest directive the overseer sent carrying `halt` passes, and a lane whose launch marker no longer binds its root, the close-out's state, is no lane. With none of these the turn is refused and the hold recorded, opening `lane-mail-check: idle=<item>` with one continuation, the lane's `lane-mail inbox` read and then its workflow, beside the ask route and the `lane-mail notice` send, which is also the route for a lane that ends its turn to wait on a dispatched agent or an armed wake, the notice naming what it waits on. On a turn the harness continued for this judge's own recorded hold it refuses nothing and sends the overseer a lane notice stating what it checked, opening `lane-mail-check: idle-notice=<item>`, or `idle-notice-unsent=<exit status>` with the sender's words where the send fails, so an idle lane is reported and never looped. A turn another stop hook's refusal continued is held as a fresh one, except on Pi, whose pi-hooks carrier runs no further request after a continued turn, so there the notice is sent with no hold before it. The record counts that notice, so the lane's next turn is judged on what the lane itself sends. An `events` listing that fails, or whose envelopes jq cannot read, is reported under `events=<status>` or `events=envelope`, and a record that is not a plain file holding a whole number and at most the word `held` under `idle-record=<path>` and rewritten. A record that cannot be written is reported under `idle-unrecorded=<path>`; under `idle-hold-unrecorded=<path>` where it was to take a hold, which is then not made, since one with no record would be made again on every continued turn; and under `idle-notice-unrecorded=<path>` where it was to count the notice, which the next turn end then reads as the lane's own send. Each of these ends the turn, because nothing a lane does at its turn end repairs its mailbox; an install with no reader leaves the turn unjudged under the marks' own `handoff-skipped` line. On Copilot the event is `agentStop`, registered in Copilot's own hook file under its camelCase name, so the payload spells its fields `sessionId`, `transcriptPath` and `toolArgs`, which this hook reads beside the snake_case spellings; its reference spells `stop_hook_active` so on both, and `toolName` goes unread, since the question-tool rule names no Copilot tool. Copilot also runs the hooks `.claude/settings.json` registers, under their PascalCase names, but the registration kendex writes there exits 0 before its script in a Copilot hook process, so a Copilot call reaches an install that is not Copilot's, the claude copy of this hook among them, only through a registration made there by hand or one kendex wrote before that skip and no refresh has rewritten. Whether Copilot made the call is read from the call, never from the install: a payload carrying `timestamp`, which both of Copilot's payload formats carry and no Claude, Codex or Pi payload does, or naming the session `sessionId`, is Copilot's, and any install but Copilot's own passes it silently, exit 0 with nothing written and nothing acknowledged, so the Copilot install is the one reader of the mailbox for a Copilot call. A Copilot agentStop names no agent: the stop whose `transcriptPath` sits in the directory named for the `sessionId`, Copilot's `session-state/<session id>/events.jsonl`, is the lead's and records it, a stop naming a transcript under another directory is read as a subagent's, handed nothing and judged on nothing, and a payload naming no transcript, or no session, is the lead's and records nothing. Copilot CLI 1.0.88 was measured firing agentStop at a custom subagent's end too, with the subagent's own `sessionId` and the lead's `transcriptPath`, which this rule reads as a subagent's. A refusal on Copilot is the documented answer for its event, on stdout beside the keyed stderr line: at a turn end `{"decision":"block","reason":<the refusal text>}` with exit 0, which Copilot stops honouring after 8 consecutive blocks, ending that turn unheld, so a handoff refusal holds a Copilot session for 8 continued turns and then returns at its next turn end, before a tool call `{"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":<the text>}` with exit 2, since any non-zero exit denies the call and the JSON carries the words, and after one `{"additionalContext":<the text>}` with exit 0, since Copilot reads a postToolUse answer only at exit 0. That halt decision is local, the mailbox peek and nothing else, so it lands inside the hook's deadline: a preToolUse hook that times out on Copilot lets the call through. A Copilot session's context is read through Copilot's own SDK event `session.usage_info`: the orch `copilot-lane-context` extension, which `open-terminal` installs in a Copilot fleet lane's `COPILOT_HOME` with the EXTENSIONS feature on, runs this hook with the argument `usage` at each reading of the session's root agent, handing it `{session_id, cwd, current_tokens, token_limit}` on stdin, and for a recorded lead session that is a launched lane's lead or the fleet's overseer, named by the same gate every arm that judges the marks asks, it records `current_tokens` as the tokens and, as the capacity, the limit Copilot compacts at: 80 percent of `token_limit`, the SDK's documented `backgroundCompactionThreshold` default, named in the record's `capacity_source`. It writes nothing on stdout; a gap is refused on stderr at exit 2, which the extension writes to the session timeline: `payload=invalid-json`, an orch install it cannot use under the key its turn end reports that gap under, `handoff-skipped=<path>`, `handoff-outside=<path>` or `handoff-unanswered=<path>`, or `context-unrecorded=<path>` for a reading that could not be written, where the session's earlier reading is removed too so its turn end reports the context unmeasured rather than judging an older figure as room. Any other session passes silently. The Copilot turn end judges this session's record under the shared context rule exactly as it judges a transcript reading, the capacity putting the handoff before Copilot's own compaction; no reading of this session, no record or a gap record, is read from the fallback below; where the pending marker the extension leaves at `~/.cache/lane-mail/copilot-usage/<session id>` for a reading it handed on and no run has recorded yet still stands after a wait of 5 seconds, the turn end reports `reading-pending=<marker>` and passes with the context unmeasured, reading no fallback, since the extension runs for that session, and never judging the earlier record as room, since nothing orders the extension's run before the turn end; and a record that stands and cannot be read is refused under `record=<path>`. Where no pending marker stands and no reading of the extension's stands for this session, no record, one naming another session, a gap record or one the fallback below wrote, which its `capacity_source` tells apart, the turn end reads the fallback: the session record the orch `copilot-statusline` command writes as the account's `statusLine`, under `<COPILOT_HOME>/lane-status/<session id>.json`, through the orch adapter for copilot, which holds the record to the payload's `sessionId`, its `transcriptPath` where one is named, the account directory and a freshness bound, and hands the shared judge the same compaction point of the window as the capacity; that reading is judged and recorded as any other harness's, and a record that does not answer leaves the context unmeasured under `reading-unrecorded=<path>` and `session-record=<reason>`, reported and passed, never read as room. An extension reading below the mark is never overridden by a statusLine record past it. Run with `compact` by the lane-mail-compact hook at a preCompact whose `trigger` is `auto`, from a recorded lead session that gate names, it flags that compaction as `compaction.json` beside the reading, the backstop for a turn that crossed into the compaction before a reading past the mark reached a turn end, and the turn end then refuses under `compacted=auto` until the handoff record stands, the overseer's whatever its succession setting; a gap there is refused under `compaction-unrecorded=<path>` on stderr at exit 2, which Copilot shows the operator without holding the compaction. A Copilot account is judged through `lanes pick --lane` like any other. Not run on gemini: it has no Stop event. Not run on antigravity: its Stop payload carries no `stop_hook_active`.
# summary: Hands lanes their overseer's mail and holds turn ends for handoff or idle checks, plus a `wake=unarmed` refusal for the registered overseer without its repeat follow or a master whose `ORCH_WAKE_PROCESS` does not match, printing `ORCH_WAKE_START`; empty master keys with no watch claim disable the check, and a running single pass is its own wake. The wake check holds Claude Code Stop, Codex Stop and Copilot CLI agentStop, is partial on Pi, and is unsupported on Gemini, Antigravity, OpenCode and Cursor; a continuation or unavailable check warns without continuing the turn.
# safety: Reads the payload, the repository's branch, the lane's launch marker, read with the shell's own `read`, and the lane mailbox directory, and for a session that is no lane the checkout's overseer mailbox and, where a file stands there and the fleet record names this session's pane, the fleet state's path from one `workflow-state path oversee` and the watch record beside it, read by the orch watch record library `lib/watch-pid.sh` sourced in a child shell from the same install as the mailbox reader, which checks the record's pid with `kill -0` and `ps`; the writes are the mailbox cursor the orch reader advances, the session's context reading, `context.json`, and a Copilot session's compaction flag, `compaction.json`, each renamed into its mailbox directory, and on a Pi lane its turn rows, `session-rows.jsonl`, appended there under that file's own lock at a turn end and at the first tool call of each turn, and for the overseer one row appended to its rows file, `session-<server>-<pane>.jsonl` in the overseer mailbox directory, under that file's own lock, a compact Stop at every overseer turn end, the overseer's directory made where the fleet has not made it yet, the fleet record's `.overseer` server start, harness and launch home where a record naming this session's pane lacks one, through one `workflow-state update oversee` in a child shell sourcing the orch `lib/lane-context.sh` and `lib/overseer-launch.sh`, and after each overseer tool call its `context.json` and, where a gap is told, `tmp/lane-mail/overseer/context-told`, and on Copilot a lead session's empty record under `~/.cache/lane-mail/copilot-leads`, touched at its session start and at each turn end its transcript proves the lead's, with records untouched for 30 days removed by one `find` at each start, as are the extension's pending markers under `~/.cache/lane-mail/copilot-usage`, which a Copilot turn end reads and polls for 5 seconds. Exit 2 names the unread count and the messages, and asks for them to be acted on, never bypassed. The reader it runs comes from its own install, never from the repository a session has open, so a repository that tracks a mailbox and an executable at that path cannot have it run. jq and cat read the payload; a payload it cannot read is refused on every turn, the continued one included, because the flag that marks a continued turn is in the payload none of those refusals reached. A mailbox whose reader is missing or fails is refused on the turns the mailbox check runs, which is every turn end but a continued one; on a continued turn that check is skipped whole, and the same missing reader is reported under `handoff-skipped` or `handoff-outside` and the turn is passed. An item name outside the alphabet a work item is spelled in, a branch that matches more than one mailbox, and a repository state git cannot report where a mailbox sits under the working directory are refused on a fresh turn and reported on a continued one and before a tool call, by the one rule the description states; none of them is ever passed in silence. For a lane's handoff marks it also reads the transcript the payload names and runs `orch-env`, `lanes` and `workflow-state` and sources the orch context library from the same install as the mailbox reader, never the open repository's, and on Pi one child shell sourcing that install's `lib/lane-launch.sh` to name the account the session's provider bills; the context reading is the one thing it writes for them. A session that names no lane costs two file tests of the checkout's overseer mailbox; where a file stands there it adds that install's resolution and, inside tmux, the overseer test below, and for the session the record names one `workflow-state path oversee`, one child shell sourcing the watch record library, and the reader's peek where no live watch stands. Outside tmux it costs nothing more, where the overseer test stops at its first condition. After a tool call a lead session with no lane of its own, in tmux, in a checkout with no `tmp/lane-mail/overseer` directory costs one stat more; where that directory stands it pays the overseer test below, and for the overseer one transcript read, one `workflow-state handoff-standing`, one `orch-env` read and one record write, the reads the turn end makes but for the account judgement; the overseer test runs once per call, and the mailbox check takes its answer. Inside tmux the overseer test costs that install's resolution, one child shell sourcing the orch context library, one tmux read and one `workflow-state` read, which together ask the oversee state whether this pane is the overseer's, plus, for a session whose pane the state names beside a server start, one child shell sourcing the orch `lib/tmux-server.sh` library for one more tmux read of its server's start; a session the state does not name stops there, after one child shell loading the orch context library, one `git-context` call and one read of the overseer's `context.json` where the state names another pane or none, and where that record names this session's pane, one `pane-unrecorded` report and one rewrite of that record. The overseer's own marks are then judged by `oversee-succeed --check-marks` from that same install, under the same 20 second ceiling the lane's account read runs under. That judgement measures the one account the overseer session runs on, through the same `lanes pick --lane` this hook asks about a lane, renewing an expired token in that account's credential file and refreshing that account's usage cache, the writes `lanes` states in its own contract; it opens no window and launches nothing. Only the last 1 MiB of the transcript is parsed, and the whole file only where that window carries no usage line, so the cost does not grow with the session. `lanes pick --lane` judges a Claude lane on its own model, measures one account and renews that account's expired token, the write its own contract states; it can wait on a credentials lock and two network calls, and on a cache miss on the host-wide usage refresh lock for up to 10 seconds and, after a 429 with nothing cached, one sleep of up to 5 seconds and one more usage request, so it runs under a 20 second ceiling that leaves the rest of the run inside this hook's 30 second budget, and a read that reaches the ceiling is reported as a gap rather than refused. Where `timeout` is not installed that read runs unbounded, and a hook the harness then kills at its budget leaves the account unjudged, the same outcome the reported gap gives without the line. For the question-tool rule it reads the payload's `tool_name` before a tool call. For the idle judge at a lane lead's turn end it runs the reader's `events` listing, which moves no cursor, and reads the kind, the box and the halt flag of each envelope, never its text and never the transcript; it writes the lane's `sent-count` record, renamed into its mailbox directory, and the one idle notice the description names, through the reader's `notice`. Every refusal opens with `lane-mail-check: <key>=<value>`; what a command this hook runs writes is captured at the site and replayed under that line, so nothing precedes the key.

# `refuse_handoff` below, the one site that builds the instruction, so no
# other path pays for text it would not print. The text is rendered once,
# written to stderr, and on Copilot handed back as the documented answer for
# the event on stdout, since there the exit status alone holds nothing: a
# turn end is held with `{"decision":"block","reason":...}` at exit 0, the one
# form its reference gives for agentStop; a tool call is denied with
# `{"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":...}` under the exit
# 2 that denies on its own, so the call is refused whichever of the two the
# CLI reads first and the words reach the model either way; and a finished
# tool call is handed `{"additionalContext":...}` at exit 0, because its
# reference logs a postToolUse exit 2 for the user and parses stdout only at
# exit 0. The reason is the same text the keyed stderr line carries. Every
# other harness takes the exit status and stderr alone. On the deliver arm
# this and hand_over are the only writers of what the model reads, and both
# put the overseer's tool-call notice, TOOL_NOTICE, ahead of their own text
# and record it told once written (tool_notice_told), so a mailbox refusal
# never withholds a crossed mark the same call judged. Where mail_check set
# ACK_LINES, the mailbox cursor moves once the answer is written and before
# the exit, so a hook killed at its budget leaves the lines unread rather
# than consumed unseen. A session
# start and a prompt are never refused: there the keyed text is a report on
# stderr at exit 0, with nothing on stdout and nothing acknowledged. A
# compaction cannot be held either, but its reference shows a non-zero exit
# to the operator as a warning while the compaction goes on, so there the
# keyed text is on stderr at exit 2 with nothing on stdout, as on every
# harness but Copilot's other events. A context reading takes no answer either:
# the extension that runs it writes the keyed text of a run that exits
# non-zero to the session timeline, so there too the text is on stderr at exit
# 2. No caller exits on its own: the status is this function's, and it never
# returns.

# Who made the call, answered here once for every arm: lead, subagent, or

# there the rest is settled by event, by what Copilot CLI 1.0.88 was measured
# sending a lead and a custom subagent it started, and 1.0.91 again
# (tools/harness-smoke's Copilot event rows):
# - agentStop: the transcript. The lead's is the session's own,
#   `session-state/<session id>/events.jsonl`, so a stop whose transcript sits
#   in a directory named for the session id is the lead's, and records it. A
#   subagent's agentStop carries the subagent's own session id and names the
#   lead's transcript, so the directory names another session and the stop is
#   a subagent's. A stop naming no transcript, or no session the alphabet above
#   admits, is the lead's and records nothing: an empty session name matches no
#   directory and would otherwise make every such stop a subagent's.
# - preToolUse, postToolUse, preCompact and usage: the lead's where the
#   session is a recorded lead, and otherwise unknown, the one rule for every
#   Copilot arm that cannot prove the lead itself. They carry neither an agent
#   nor a transcript the rule above can trust, and a custom subagent's carry a
#   session id no sessionStart announced; a preCompact names a transcript, but
#   what a subagent's names is unmeasured, and a usage reading is the one the
#   extension took of the session's root agent, under the session id the hooks
#   see. An unknown caller is handed no mail and acknowledges none, so such a
#   subagent cannot take the lead's directive, which the lead's turn end hands
#   over; under a halt it is never shown the read that clears the halt, and
#   mail_check states why that read still passes. Its compaction flags nothing
#   and its reading is recorded nowhere, so a subagent never marks the lead's
#   session. Whether a built-in task-tool subagent's calls carry their own
#   session id or the lead's is a pending live-lane proof: one whose calls
#   carry the lead's is read as the lead, handed the lead's mail after its
#   calls, which marks it read, and under a halt shown the read that clears it.
# - sessionStart: the lead's, and recorded, being the session's own start.
# - userPromptSubmitted: the lead's, and never recorded: that a subagent's
#   prompt fires no such hook is unmeasured.
# - a row: sessionStart and sessionEnd are the lead's, Copilot firing neither
#   for a subagent.
# - caller: the agentStop rule, being the turn end doc-drift-check asks about.

# for, and a session with no orch skill installed still ends its turns and
# runs its tools.

# Whether a live watch holds the fleet state at this checkout: 0 where the

# the watch never reports. With no live watch that session is handed the lines,
# a fleet watched in single passes included, since such a watch writes no
# record; the next pass then does not report them. The state's path is the install's own `workflow-state path oversee` from the

# --- the question rule ---------------------------------------------------
#
# A lane asks its overseer only through lane mail: the overseer reads the
# mailbox and never the pane, so a harness question dialog reaches nobody, and
# on a hosted fleet the item stalls until a person finds the pane. The tool is
# refused by its name, the one fact a call carries about it, on every harness
# alike; a Pi-only route that turned Pi's question tool into a lane-mail ask
# would be a second path for the one ask lane mail already carries. A
# question the lane writes as words instead is the idle judge's below, which
# reads no words.
# Neither holds a session that is no launched lane: an ordinary session asks
# its user through its harness as it always did, and a committed mailbox poses
# as no lane here, as it poses as none for the mailbox check.

# The harness question tools, by the names their PreToolUse payloads carry:
# Claude Code's AskUserQuestion and EnterPlanMode, whose plan ends in an
# approval dialog; Codex's request_user_input; and the `question` tool
# pi-questions registers on Pi, which the pi-hooks carrier hands over under
# its own id. The one list of those names: the launch words that take each
# tool away live in the orch skill's lane-launch library, and the table in

# stopped, whatever it said there. The facts are the reader's own `lane-mail
# events` listing and the count this judge recorded at the lane's last judged
# turn end:
#   - an ask or a notice the lane sent since then, which the listing's count of
#     them against the record shows;
#   - the lane's handoff record, which ends the run in handoff_check before this
#     judge is reached;
#   - a halt standing, the newest directive the overseer sent carrying `halt`;
#   - the close-out, which leaves no launch marker binding the lane's root, so
#     the session is no lane and is judged on nothing.
# With none of them the turn is held or reported to the overseer; the

# --- the handoff marks ---------------------------------------------------
#
# A lane hands ITSELF off. The overseer's `lanes context` poll of the readings
# this hook records is a backstop: no watch event carries a context figure, and
# an overseer between events, at its own wall or in succession reads nothing at
# all, so lanes ran 50 to 190 thousand tokens past the mark waiting to be told.
# Two marks fire one instruction, and the lane's own handoff record clears
# both.
#
# The OVERSEER is judged here too, on two marks of its own. It does not share
# the reads below: `oversee-succeed --check-marks` is the one judge of where an
# overseer's marks sit and what its own pane and account say, and this hook
# acts on the key that judgement printed. Its escape is the succession, with
# the same record behind it, so a succession that refuses still leaves a turn
# end it can reach.
#
# The turn-end arm and the lane lead alone: a tool call is not a point to hand
# off at, and a subagent runs its own window on its own turn. The mailbox is
# handed over first and the marks are judged after it, so an overseer's own
# directive still reaches a lane that is about to hand off; every turn-end path
# the mailbox has nothing to say on arrives here.
#
# A handoff refusal is made on `stop_hook_active` turns too, unlike everything
# else this hook refuses but the idle judge's hold on a turn another hook
# continued, which its own record bounds. The escapes differ: this hook's own acknowledgement
# clears unread mail and nothing clears a resolution failure, so repeating
# either is the loop the flag exists to end, while only the LANE can write the
# handoff record, and a single refusal it declines to act on ends the session
# with nothing recorded.

# different session, and a record answering for it would pass its turn end
# past both marks in silence for the life of that session. So the record names
# the session that wrote it, and only that session reads it as its own.

# neither field and is nobody's, so the marks are judged as if none stood: the
# refusal that follows has its own escape, which a silence would not.
#
# The answer is jq's own exit status under `-e`: a record naming this session
# is the only truthy result, and every other outcome — a false comparison, a
# record with no such field, an empty verdict line with nothing under it, and

# --- the overseer's context at every tool call ---------------------------
#
# The overseer's context mark, judged after each of its tool calls as well as
# at its turn end, so a mark crossed mid-turn is read at the next tool call:
# a turn that runs into the window never reaches the turn end that would judge
# it, and the session then answers no mail and no event until someone finds
# the pane. The reading is the one the turn end takes (overseer_context_read),
# recorded to the overseer mailbox's context.json, so the record also advances
# while the overseer works and oversee-watch reads a fresh figure. Who judges
# the overseer's context mark, and on what, is
# the orch skill's Oversee events § Judgement rules, the overseer's
# own case; here it is context_mark_judge.
# The account triggers stay out of this call, since an account read at every
# tool call would cost a usage request per call.
#
# What it hands over is TOOL_NOTICE, which the deliver arm's two writers,
# hand_over and refuse, put ahead of their own text on stdout and stderr, so a
# mailbox refusal on the same call carries it too; nothing here writes to the
# model. A reached mark, and a mark setting it cannot
# be judged on, are handed over at every tool call until the handoff record
# stands or the succession lands. Every other line, a lost fleet record, an
# unbound or unread transcript, a missing orch-env, a record that could not be
# written, is handed over once per session and first line, the last told kept
# in context-told below, so a standing gap does not fill the window it is
# about; a run with nothing to say clears it, so a gap that comes back is told
# again. Only a session this run establishes as the overseer, or finds to be
# the overseer the record lost, touches that file: any other lead session in
# the checkout writes its lines to stderr alone and leaves the overseer's
# record as it stands. Only a lead's call, in tmux, in a checkout whose
# overseer mailbox directory stands, is judged: that directory is what a fleet
# or this session's own first turn end makes, and every other session pays one
# stat.
#
# Called plainly from the main flow, so every status is tested where it is
# taken. The judgement runs in a subshell, so ITEM and ROLE, which it sets to
# the overseer's, stand as they were for the mailbox check after it.
