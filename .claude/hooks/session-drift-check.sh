# name: session-drift-check
# event: SessionStart
# description: On a fresh session start (not resume or compact), runs `kendex check --quiet` and surfaces kendex drift to the agent — outdated items (`kendex refresh`), items removed upstream (`kendex remove <name>`, `-g` in a global section), unreachable sources, and packages not yet evaluated against their sources (a background refresh settles them). Prints nothing when the install is current. KENDEX_DRIFT_HOOK=off disables it.
# summary: Tells a coding agent at the start of a session which installed packages no longer match their source, and what to run about it. Says nothing when everything matches.
# safety: Informational only — never installs or removes anything and never touches the project's git state. The check never waits on the network; the only thing it may write is kendex's own cache bookkeeping under ~/.kendex/cache (fetch stamps), and when a source cache there is older than its TTL, a detached background process refreshes it (git fetch + reset, confined to that cache) and this hook does not wait for it. Every suggestion requires user approval before acting. Every notice opens with `session-drift-check: <key>=<value>`; what a command this hook runs writes is captured at the site and replayed under that line, so nothing precedes the key. `kendex check`'s own report is relayed on stdout under those lines, preserved exactly; which arm its exit code chose is a value on them, not a sentence in it.
# timeout: 30
# harnesses: [claude-code, codex]

# Strict, and a session must still start no matter what this hook hits: every
# command that can legitimately fail is guarded so this always reaches exit 0.

# What the notice reads, each under its own name: kendex's report and the
# status it left, and the line an unguarded failure reached. A positional
# detail would mean a status to one caller and a line number to another, and a
# value whose meaning depends on the caller is not a stable value.

# Every line this hook writes, and the only place its text lives. The first
# line is the contract a reader parses, `session-drift-check: <key>=<value>`: a
# stable key for the condition and the value acted on — the missing tool, the
# unreachable project directory, what became of the check, or the status an
# unguarded command left. The English explanation and kendex's own report
# follow it. Every line goes to stdout, the session-start context channel.
# The keyed line stands first, at position 1, and every line this function
# writes goes to stdout: this hook has no stderr channel, and nothing it runs
# leaves a cause for it to replay — kendex's report is data it relays, not a
# diagnostic.
