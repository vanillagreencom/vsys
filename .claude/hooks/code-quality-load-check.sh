# matcher: Edit|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit|Write
# description: Refuses an Edit, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit or Write onto a path inside a git work tree until the agent making the call has loaded the code-quality skill, so the repository rule "load the code-quality skill before writing or changing code" is decided rather than remembered. Loaded is read off the transcript that records that agent's tool calls: a `Skill` tool call whose `skill` input is `code-quality`. That transcript is the session transcript the payload names, or, when the payload carries `agent_id` because a subagent made the call, the subagent's own `agent-<agent_id>.jsonl` under the session's `subagents/` directory, directly or one directory below; the lead session's load does not pass a subagent's edit. The work tree's own `tmp/` is scratch and passes — commit messages, status files and notes — and so does every path outside a work tree, which is where a session's temporary files belong. Every session in the repository is judged, not only a delegated agent. KENDEX_CODE_QUALITY_HOOK=off disables it for a session that is not editing the repository under those rules. Claude Code only, the harness whose payload names the transcript and whose Skill tool records the load.
# summary: Holds back edits to a repository until the agent making them has loaded the code-quality skill, so the standard is applied rather than remembered.
# safety: Reads the payload, asks git where the target path is, and reads the transcript of the agent making the call; writes nothing. A payload, a git answer or a transcript it cannot read is refused, never passed, so an unreadable state never reads as loaded: an `agent_id` that is not a string of ASCII letters, digits, `_` and `-`, the alphabet the harness names subagents in, or that names no single subagent transcript, is refused. The refusal names the skill to load and the path it refused, and never a bypass. Every refusal opens with `code-quality-load-check: <key>=<value>`; what a command this hook runs writes is captured at the site and replayed under that line, so nothing precedes the key.
