# description: Block a recursive rm with a path operand that starts with a variable that may expand empty — a path outside the working tree wherever that variable is empty or unset. Names the rewrite the harness accepts without a prompt.
# safety: The harness stops the whole session on that shape with a "Dangerous rm operation on possibly-empty variable path" prompt; refusing it here lets the agent rewrite and continue. One regex over the raw command decides: an rm, a recursion flag — a single-dash cluster carrying r or R, or `--recursive` — and an operand rooted in `$NAME`, `${NAME}` or `${NAME:-…}`, in either order and wherever in that command they stand. `${NAME:?…}` is the one form that cannot expand empty and it passes, and a redirection target is not an operand. Reading the three parts wherever they stand refuses a harmless command that merely spells them — `git rm -r --cached $X`, a quoted `rm -rf $X` inside an echo — and that is the accepted cost: it fails closed, so it stalls one command rather than deleting a tree. A bypass the shell would assemble — a quoted flag, a line continuation, a variable holding the flag — is not seen here; the harness prompt is the backstop, and this hook only spares the session that stall.

# The whole rule, built from named parts so each one is readable on its own.
# The parts count WHEREVER they stand in the command. There is no
# command-position test: one was tried, and a hand-written list of the keywords
# that may precede an rm is an enumeration of shell grammar — every revision of
# it named fewer members than it missed, and `if`, `while`, `until`, `!` and
# `time` all carried a real variable-rooted recursive rm straight past it.
# ENDERS is what remains of that reading: it says where one command ends and
# the next begins, so GAP and SKIP exclude it and a scan never REACHES out of
# the command it began in.
#
#   ENDERS    the characters that END one command: `;`, `&`, `|` and a newline.
#             The newline is one of them because the words of the next line are
#             not this rm's operands.
#   RM_EDGE   what may stand immediately left of the `rm`: the start of the
#             command, or any character an identifier cannot hold, so
#             `confirm -rf $X` is one word and not this hook's rm. It is a word
#             boundary and nothing more — bash's `=~` runs without REG_NEWLINE,
#             so `^` alone would never reach line two of a multi-line call, and
#             a newline is one of the characters this admits.
#   RECURSE   a flag word that means recursion: a single-dash cluster carrying
#             `r` or `R`, or `--recursive` spelled out. A long flag merely
#             holding an r (`--verbose`, `--interactive`, `--preserve-root`) is
#             not one — without recursion the path is a file, and the harness
#             does not prompt.
#   ROOT      an operand rooted in a variable that may expand empty: `$NAME`,
#             `${NAME}`, `${NAME:-…}`. `${NAME:?…}` aborts on empty and is the
#             accepted rewrite, so it is the one variable root that passes; the
#             identifier test is what keeps `${X+x:?}` — an unset-guarded
#             ALTERNATIVE whose text merely contains :? — on the refused side.
#             A leading double quote is peeled, since quoting does not stop an
#             empty expansion; a single-quoted run is a literal the shell never
#             expands and is not a variable root.
#   GAP       the whitespace standing between two words of ONE command. It is
#             horizontal whitespace and nothing else, because the only
#             whitespace character in ENDERS is the newline: a gap that crossed
#             one would read the next command's words as this rm's operands.
#   SPACE     whitespace INCLUDING that newline, spelled apart from GAP so the
#             one place it belongs is the one place it stands: after a trailing
#             RECURSE, where a newline ends the flag word rather than reaching
#             past it.
#   SKIP      the words the scan crosses to get from one part to the next: GAP
#             then a run of CROSSABLE, repeated. CROSSABLE is any character but
#             ENDERS, `<`, `>` and whitespace, so it is a word BODY and GAP is
#             the one thing between two words. An ender would end this rm, and
#             a redirection target is not an operand at all, so
#             `rm -rf /var/tmp/x > $LOG` is not a variable-rooted rm. Crossing
#             ordinary words is what reaches a LATER operand and a flag written
#             after the operand, both of which GNU rm accepts.
#
# Both orders are spelled out rather than folded together: the flag before the
# operand, and the operand before the flag.
#
# The awk segmenter and flag folder this replaced answered a quoted `"-rf"`, a
# backslash-split `-r""f`, a line continuation and a dash-leading operand after
# `--`. Those are not seen here, and that is the trade: it is the frozen
# lexical-scanner class, and a finding of that shape against this file is
# declined, not patched. The harness prompt still stops every one of them; what
# it costs is the stall this hook exists to spare.
# The ampersand leads so this string does not spell bash 4's case fall-through
# operator, which tools/bash32-lint flags in string data too. A bracket
# expression carries no order, so the set below is the set named above.
