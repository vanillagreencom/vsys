# name: task-completed-check
# event: TaskCompleted
# matcher:
# description: Before a task is marked complete, runs `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` against the repository's Cargo.toml, or the nearest one above a changed file when the root has none, whenever a Rust file changed in the working tree, the index or as an untracked file, and refuses the completion naming the first error lines, or the output tail when there are none. Rust only.
# summary: Runs clippy before a task is marked complete whenever Rust files changed, and refuses the completion with the first errors it found.
# safety: Refuses on any clippy failure and on a git that cannot list the changed set. Claude Code does not block on a hook that outruns its budget, so the budget is that harness's own default for a command hook; a cold build of a large workspace that outruns it completes the task unchecked, and a warm target directory is what keeps this gate closed. Every refusal opens with `task-completed-check: <key>=<value>`; what a command this hook runs writes is captured at the site and replayed under that line, so nothing precedes the key.

# Every line this hook writes, and the only place its text lives. The first
# line is the contract a reader parses, `task-completed-check: <key>=<value>`:
# a stable key for the condition and the value acted on — the git subcommand
# that could not answer, or the status clippy left. The English explanation and
# the diagnostics follow it.
# The keyed line stands first, at position 1. What a command this hook runs
# wrote is captured where the hook reads it and passed here as the cause, so
# it is replayed under the key rather than ahead of it.
