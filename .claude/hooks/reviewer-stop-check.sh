# description: Blocks a reviewer subagent's stop once when the worktree it reviewed is not clean. The worktree is the one the artifact path in the subagent's transcript names (`<worktree>/tmp/review-<agent>-*.json`, the newest mention); `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all` there listing anything blocks, naming each path, and a transcript naming no artifact path blocks the same way, since the review contract is an artifact at that path. An agent_type not starting with `reviewer-` passes, as does `stop_hook_active` true; a block is recorded per agent_id under `<git common dir>/kendex/reviewer-stop/` so a later stop of the same subagent passes. Claude Code only, the harness with a SubagentStop event that names the agent.
# summary: Stops a reviewer agent from finishing while the worktree it reviewed still holds files it left behind.
# safety: Reads the payload, the transcript and git status; the only write is the per-agent marker under the reviewed repository's git common dir. Exit 2 names the paths and asks for the reviewer's own files to be deleted and the rest reported, never bypassed. jq is required to read the payload; a payload, transcript or git that cannot be read is refused, never passed, and so is an `agent_id` that is not a string of ASCII letters, digits, `_` and `-`, the alphabet the harness names subagents in; it is judged in jq where the payload holds it, so a NUL, a `/`, a newline, `.` or `..` never reaches the marker path, whatever encoding the read passes through. Every refusal opens with `reviewer-stop-check: <key>=<value>`; what a command this hook runs writes is captured at the site and replayed under that line, so nothing precedes the key.
