# description: Shows the user a notice through stdout systemMessage JSON when unchanged documents may need an update after covered code changes. Uses the nearest tracked non-root AGENTS.md and architecture topic Covers entries. Compares the branch with its default-branch merge-base, or the working tree when no comparison applies. Every Stop reports independently. Claude Code only.
# safety: Read-only notice. Always exits 0, including when discovery fails; failures report that the notice is unavailable. Does not parse session payloads or write session state.
