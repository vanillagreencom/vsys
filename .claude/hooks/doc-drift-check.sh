# description: Blocks a stop once per set of findings so the agent, the only party that can act on them, is the one given the list. Three kinds are found: stale, a document covering changed code that did not change; dangling, an architecture topic `Covers:` entry that no tracked or untracked non-ignored path on disk matches; uncovered, a changed non-markdown path still on disk that no topic entry and no AGENTS.md covers, judged only where some topic declares an entry. A changed path the repository's `.kendex-generated.json` lists is named at neither kind, a render being covered through the source it was rendered from. The refusal opens with one keyed line per kind that holds, in the order `doc-drift-check: stale=<count>`, `doc-drift-check: dangling=<count>`, `doc-drift-check: uncovered=<count>`, then `doc-drift-check: base=<ref>` — the ref it compared against, or `default-branch`, `none` or `unrelated` — and names each finding under them; stdout carries nothing and no user-facing notice is written. The set is recorded as `<git common dir>/kendex/doc-drift/<session_id>-<digest of the sorted set>`, so a later stop naming that same set passes and an agent that read the list and changed nothing is not asked again; a set that gains or loses a finding is a different set and blocks once. `stop_hook_active` true passes, and so does a stop with nothing changed; any change, markdown alone included, has every Covers entry judged. Uses the nearest AGENTS.md, tracked or untracked and not ignored, which for a path directly at the repository root is the root's own and for a path below it is one below the root, and architecture topic Covers entries. Compares the branch with its default-branch merge-base, or the working tree when no comparison applies. A documentation HTML page under docs/ with `<!-- Covers: sibling.md -->` and its Markdown companion must change together; a missing companion is dangling. Claude Code only.
# summary: Stops an agent when a covering document did not change with its code or a declared HTML and Markdown pair changed on only one side. It also names Covers entries whose target does not exist.
# safety: Reads the payload, git state, the topic files, the render inventory `.kendex-generated.json` and git's listing of what each Covers entry matches; the only write is the per-set marker under the repository's git common dir. Exit 2 names the findings and asks for each document to be confirmed or updated and each entry or path to be corrected, never bypassed. jq reads the payload and a sha256 tool names the set; every command the hook runs is checked before it is called, the payload readers ahead of the payload and the rest after `stop_hook_active` has been read, so a discovery command's absence costs one retry rather than refusing the retry too; only a missing payload reader refuses that as well, the flag being in the payload it cannot read. A payload, git state, render inventory or marker the hook cannot read or write is refused, never passed. Every refusal opens with `doc-drift-check: <key>=<value>`; what a command this hook runs writes is captured at the site and replayed under that line, so nothing precedes the key.
